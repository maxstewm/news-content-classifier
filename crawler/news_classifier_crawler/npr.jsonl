{"url":"https://variety.com/2003/tv/news/news-24-reaches-for-the-sky-1117897065/","title":"News 24 reaches for the Sky","extracted_core_text":"LONDON — Running a 24-hour news channel should be a no-brainer for one of the world’s biggest news organizations — particularly when it’s spending around £50 million ($85 million) a year of taxpayers’ money.\nBBC News 24 has nevertheless faced just that problem, and the digital channel relaunched last week in an attempt to address six years of criticism and remedy disappointing ratings.\nThe majority of viewers still get their news from the terrestrial channels. But auds with access to cable and satellite prefer the snappy style of Rupert Murdoch satcaster BSkyB’s highly regarded Sky News, which frequently breaks stories before its staid BBC rival.\nPopular on Variety\nHowever, News 24 is resisting the urge to lure auds by “Fox-ifying” news — i.e., parroting the sensational, partisan style of another Murdoch asset, the U.S.-based Fox News.\nInstead, News 24 is going upscale, playing to the Beeb’s traditional strengths of analysis and explanation.\n“If anything, we’re going to become more broadsheet,” says BBC head of television news Roger Mosey, using the British term for more weighty newspapers such as the Times. “If you do news, you have to do serious news. No one has yet showed that news ‘lite’ works.\n“We will not lead hour after hour with crime or missing person stories, which Sky does — which is perfectly proper for its audience. We will always be stronger on politics, business and current affairs.”\nNews 24 head Rachel Attwell adds: “We are not competing to be first because first doesn’t necessarily mean right. There will be occasions when we’ll hold back.”\nMosey also believes “the energy of the channel will be improved by changing the on-air look.”\nNews 24 now has a contemporary post-modern glass and chrome design and enough studio space for presenters to walk around.\nChanging the set is the easy bit. The hard part is delivering “an intelligent broad agenda” in a celebrity-fixated culture.\nThe relaunch was prompted by a government-initiated report, carried out by ex-Financial Times editor Richard Lambert and published a year ago, lambasting News 24’s lack of originality.\nInsiders blame that on the BBC. “When you create a news channel, you have to decide what you want it to be,” says one news vet. “Will it be a headline service or will it be event-driven? The BBC originally launched News 24 without a clear idea of what they wanted.\n“It was second division, half-news, half-features, with no real, distinctive sense of what it was attempting to do.”\nHowever, defining its more serious news edge does not solve the digital news channel’s main problem: It lives in the shadow of the pubcaster’s giant newsgathering machine for terrestrial TV and radio outlets.\nWith the traditional network bulletins still the primary focus of the global news team’s efforts, serving the needs of News 24 has often been an afterthought for BBC staff, and an irritating one at that.\nSome top presenters and reporters would prefer not to be seen dead on it.\nIn contrast, Sky News’ dedicated staff serves its needs around the clock.\nInitial reaction to the revamp has been skeptical, with some commentators failing to notice any improvement so far. But it is still early, and the BBC is attempting to turn News 24 into a distinctive service.\nOne of the revamped News 24’s innovations is the introduction of a thrice-daily “Fact File” in which journalist Nick Higham uses inhouse research to explain the big stories and put them into context.\nIronically, Higham, the pubcaster’s ex-arts and media correspondent, recently accused the BBC of running too many “insignificant and trivial” entertainment and sports stories in news bulletins.\n“The one thing News 24 can do that Sky can’t is marshal the resources of a large team of specialist reporters,” a BBC correspondent says. “This means we can help our audience understand complex issues.”\nThe proof will be in the ratings. Sky News’ weekly reach is 4.9 million compared to News 24 at 4.3 million.\n“Sky News is good,” concedes Mosey, “but you have to remember that it is much simpler running one news channel than running alongside all our other news output on the terrestrial channels and our other outlets, including radio and the Web.”\nIf News 24 is really to shine, perhaps the BBC needs to think hard about integrating it within the rest of its sprawling news empire, instead of operating it as a semi-autonomous unit. “The BBC structure doesn’t help,” says a rival.\nFor the sake of the good name of the BBC, and for those viewers seeking a different kind of TV news, News 24 cannot afford to fail a second time around.","extracted_keywords":["news","channel","stories","hour","year","problem","ratings","viewers","channels","auds"]}

{"url":"https://www.webmd.com/children/story/high-blood-pressure-in-children","title":"Childhood Hypertension: What Parents Should Know","extracted_core_text":"Cate, Bradley, Chris, and Nate Ewing\nBy Joe Kita\nMarch 28, 2024\nChris and Bradley Ewing were vacationing near Lake Michigan in July 2023 when their 15-year-old son, Nate, started telling them that his heart was racing and that he was \"not feeling right.\" Nate, who had been adopted from Ethiopia with his twin sister, Cate, when they were infants, was about to start high school and try out for the football team. One of his idols, 18-year-old LeBron \"Bronny\" James Jr., had just had a cardiac arrest and collapsed during basketball practice. The news was all over social media.\nChris and Bradley, who live in Cincinnati, attributed their son's symptoms to anxiety. After all, Nate was thin and fit, and although he'd been diagnosed with ADHD in second grade, he'd had normal wellness exams ever since. But when he continued to report lightheadedness and unusual feelings in his chest, they sought help. Yet visits to the school nurse, then their pediatrician, and a cardiologist all ended with assurances that Nate’s heart was normal and healthy.\nTo be certain, the cardiologist had Nate wear an ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) monitor for 24 hours. But the device malfunctioned and its subsequent alarms stressed Nate out even more, to the point where he refused to repeat the process. Chris tried testing his blood pressure manually at home. The results were inconclusive. It wasn't until January 2024 when a second cardiologist convinced Nate to try the ABP monitor again. It showed clear evidence of high blood pressure (hypertension).\n\"The biggest challenge was just figuring out what was wrong. It took so long to get a diagnosis.\"\n-Chris Ewing\n\"Doctors and nurses just assume you know what blood pressure numbers mean,\" Bradley Ewing says. \"They'd send us home with a monitor and explain what to do, but we still didn't really know what we were looking for. Is this high? Is this low? We were flying blind.\"\nNate is now on blood pressure medication and doing better.\n\"The biggest challenge was just figuring out what was wrong,\" says Chris Ewing, who's thankful that nothing serious happened to Nate during those intervening months. \"It took so long to get a diagnosis. I wish someone had educated us more about hypertension and how it presents in children.\"\nAlarming Statistics\nAs many as 5% of U.S. children and teens under age 18 may have hypertension, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). That's up to 3.6 million kids with a serious condition that used to be found mainly in older adults. And 10% more, or 7.3 million, may have elevated blood pressure, putting them in danger of developing hypertension later. (Elevated blood pressure is above normal but below hypertension.) These statistics are four times higher than they were 30 to 40 years ago.\nThe causes are clear. Childhood obesity rates rose from 5% in the late 1970s to 19.7% in 2020, according to the CDC. This is a major risk factor for hypertension, as are poor nutrition, a sedentary lifestyle, too much sodium, poor sleep, energy drinks packed with sugar and caffeine, and (as is likely in Nate's case) genetics. All can chronically raise blood pressure.\nIn March 2023, the American Heart Association (AHA) published a scientific statement calling pediatric hypertension an \"unrecognized condition\" and alerting medical personnel (and parents) about how common it is and how to accurately diagnose and treat it.\nBonita Falkner, MD, who led the team of experts who wrote the AHA statement, sees cause for concern. \"Essentially, many of these children have a medical profile that's already similar to their grandparents,\" says Falkner, a professor emeritus of medicine and pediatrics at Thomas Jefferson University who has studied pediatric hypertension for 20 years.\nBlood Vessels Aging Too Soon\n\"The problem with children having unmanaged hypertension or elevated blood pressure is that it adds a pressure burden to their cardiovascular systems and kidneys for a much longer time,\" Falkner says. \"These children are already showing signs of vascular aging, meaning their blood vessels are a little stiffer and their heart muscles are a bit bigger. Fortunately, hypertension can be managed and even reversed with lifestyle changes (including better nutrition, more exercise, and weight loss) and, if necessary, medication. This first requires awareness of the problem and then early and accurate detection — two things that the AAP says are lacking.\n\"The diagnosis is missed in up to 75% of pediatric patients in primary care settings,\" the AAP stated in its 2017 guidelines on pediatric hypertension. The AHA's more recent statement shows that progress has been slow.\nA Routine Check That's Often Skipped\nBefore the mid-1970s, doctors typically didn't measure blood pressure in children without symptoms. \"It was assumed children did not have hypertension,\" Falkner says. Since 2017, the AAP has recommended making it a routine part of annual wellness checks from age 3.\nBut this procedure isn't as routine as it may sound.\nMargaret Solomon, MD, is a pediatrician and internal medicine doctor at the Redwood Health Center in Salt Lake City, UT. Since 2005, she has been attending to an ethnically diverse and often economically disadvantaged patient population. Despite her best efforts to make everyone more aware of this \"silent illness\" through accurate diagnosis, education, and management, \"a lot of these kids with blood pressure issues are becoming adults with hypertension,\" she says. \"I've been here long enough to see the evolution.\"\nGetting an accurate reading from youngsters is challenging. Solomon says, \"They rush in from school, they're here to get shots, they're nervous, they can't sit still ... so we're often dealing with measurement issues.\" This is the first obstacle. Some busy doctors, who can see up to 25 patients a day with their families, may attribute a high reading to anxiety (so-called \"white coat hypertension\") and dismiss it, or just make a note to check it at the child's next wellness visit.\n\"At our center we always do an initial automated blood pressure measurement,\" Solomon says. \"If that's abnormal, we wait for a while until the child is less anxious and do two manual measurements. Then we average the three.\"\nThe second obstacle is determining what that number means. Because kids' blood vessels are smaller overall, the blood pressure levels used to separate normal from abnormal in adults don't apply to those under 13 years of age. Doctors must figure out what percentile the child is in based on age, sex, and height, then consult a standardized table to determine their blood pressure category. For teens, the benchmarks are the same as for adults.\nThis process isn't simple. \"Kids are dynamic organisms,\" says Solomon. \"They're growing and changing, so you have to look at different charts to assess their blood pressures. I've always found it a bit overwhelming.\" Even Falkner, with decades of expertise, admits it can be time-consuming and confusing for doctors, not to mention parents.\nUsing Tech to Simplify Diagnosis\nTo make things more efficient, Solomon helped develop and implement a \"best practice alert\" at her health center. Created with the support of the IT department at the University of Utah Health system, it automates this entire process. Here's how it works:\nWhen an initial blood pressure is abnormal, an alert pops up on the computer screen telling the medical assistant to take two more manual readings (one with a stethoscope and one with a blood pressure cuff) later in the visit. Once that's done, the program automatically averages the three readings and analyzes the result based on the child's age, sex, and height. When further action is needed, a diagram pops up on screen showing AAP recommendations for treatment. The program will even automatically schedule a follow-up visit in a few weeks or months with either the attending pediatrician or a specialist.\n\"It helps make sure nothing sneaks through the cracks,\" Solomon says.\nThe best practice alert system was built using Epic Software — an electronic health records system common in hospitals, medical offices, and health clinics — according to AAP guidelines. Solomon says it could probably be easily replicated elsewhere.\nWhat Parents Can Do\nUntil programs like the best practice alert system become more widespread, Solomon and Falkner recommend that parents become advocates for their child's well-being on this important issue. Their advice: Don't hesitate to ask that your child's blood pressure be taken, especially if hypertension runs in your family. And if the nurse or medical assistant just recites the reading with no explanation, ask for clarification.\n\"Don't accept, 'It's OK,\" Falkner says. \"Ask for the number and where that stands given the child's percentile or age. If it's a little high, ask the doctor if more tests are needed or what else can be done.\"\n\"Simple lifestyle changes like becoming more active as a family and making healthier food choices can make a huge difference.\"\n-Margaret Solomon, MD\nIt works the other way, too. When Jennifer Bright of Hellertown, PA, took her 12-year-old son, Austin, for his annual wellness check, his initial blood pressure was 130/90.\n\"The nurse looked at me, alarmed, and launched into a speech about the dangers of high blood pressure,\" Bright says. \"I calmly asked if she could take it again. Then I turned to Austin and explained that blood pressure can read high if you're talking or under stress. So I asked him to relax, rest his feet on the floor, close his eyes, and take some deep breaths. When the nurse took it again, it was normal. He was just nervous.\"\nBright now reminds Austin to do breathing exercises at every doctor's visit or whenever he's feeling stressed, even at school. \"It turned out to be a great teaching opportunity,\" she says, \"and his blood pressure has been normal ever since.\"\nIf your child is diagnosed with elevated blood pressure or hypertension, Solomon encourages parents to stay positive. \"Don't [say], 'Oh my gosh, my kid has high blood pressure, and he's going to be sick for the rest of his life,'\" she says. \"Yes, this is a chronic illness, but we know a lot about it, and it can be successfully managed. Simple lifestyle changes like becoming more active as a family and making healthier food choices can make a huge difference,\" not only for their blood pressure but also for every other aspect of their health — now and for years to come.","extracted_keywords":["blood","pressure","hypertension","child","children","age","doctors","parents","school","practice"]}

Also hoping to compete is American skier Lindsey Vonn, who earlier this year came out of retirement and concluded her comeback season with a second-place finish in a World Cup super-G race.\n“A lot of women and girls are afraid to try because of the fear of failure, and I’ve fallen a million times and I’ve always gotten back up, so I’m not afraid to fail at anything,” Vonn said.\nIt is this defiance in the face of potential failure which is key to Vonn’s success. The American star came second in the super-G at the World Cup finals in March to become the oldest female Alpine skier to make the podium of a World Cup race by six years.\nShe retired from the sport in February 2019 but announced last year she would be returning to the slopes after undergoing a successful partial knee replacement in April 2024.\nVonn acknowledged that there are factors that some consider detrimental to her ability to win.\n“Is my age a factor? Yeah. (Are) my, are my injuries a factor? Yes, but … you’ve got to do what you love, and if I fail, so be it, but I always believed in myself, and it’s gotten me this far,” Vonn told CNN.\n“A lot of people say as they get older, the fear increases – that’s your mind. Do what you set your mind to. If you believe you can’t do it, then of course.”\nVonn has already expressed her desire to conclude this chapter of her career at the Winter Games. She already has a record 12 World Cup wins at Cortina d’Ampezzo.\nShe told the Associated Press that she was “definitely am thinking about (the Olympics) and I hope that I can get there.”\n“I have to keep things going and if I can make it, it would be a thrilling and a great way to kind of close the loop on my career – I guess the second chapter of my career. But I’m really trying not to think that far ahead,” she told AP.\nVonn has plenty of supporters who think she has a shot at medaling again.\n“I’m pretty sure Lindsey can win at least one medal,” three-time Olympic champion Maria Höfl-Riesch told CNN Sports.\n”I mean she could do it in both events, of course. I think it depends on if it’s working in the first one, then maybe the second one is coming easier.”\nVonn said she was hopeful for herself and Gu when it came to bagging medals.\n“I would say you (Eileen) got three last Olympics. My best was two and I have three potential events. So I think, on average, we should hopefully come away with three or four. I think four would be a pretty solid bet,” Vonn said.","extracted_keywords":["failure","women","fear","career","medals","skiing","face","champion","moment","story"]}

Jordan, Kanye West, Kid Cudi","extracted_core_text":"Jury selection for Sean “Diddy” Combs’ sex trafficking trial began Monday morning in New York as a media circus surrounded the courthouse in Lower Manhattan.\nOne hundred and fifty potential jurors were asked to fill out a questionnaire that gauged their knowledge of Combs, their views on law enforcement, whether they have experienced a sexual assault and more. They were also given a list of at least 190 people including celebrities and public figures and asked to indicate which names they recognized.\nAmong the names on that list are Michael B. Jordan, Kanye West, Mike Myers and Kid Cudi. It’s unclear how the names on the list relate to the Combs trial, if at all. Combs is known to have hosted big Hollywood parties and was well-connected among celebrities.\nPopular on Variety\nProsecutors believe that Kid Cudi, for one, is the victim of a car bombing committed by Combs in 2011. During that time, the “Pursuit of Happiness” rapper was romantically involved with Combs’ longtime ex-girlfriend, Casandra “Cassie” Ventura, the star witness of the federal trial.\nA source familiar with the case indicates to Variety that Jordan will not be a witness. The “Sinners” actor went on a date with Ventura in 2015 and Combs was said to be upset about it.\nOther names listed include Destiny’s Child singer Michelle Williams, actor Lauren London, singer Dawn Richard, singer-producer Dallas Austin and many of Combs’ family members. A surprising number of potential jurors indicated that they were not familiar with any of the names.\nCombs’ trial is expected to last at least eight weeks. Jury selection will take place until May 12, which is when opening arguments will likely occur.\nThirty-two prospective jurors were interviewed by Judge Arun Subramanian on Monday. They were given the option to discuss sensitive or personal questions in a private sidebar with just the judge, court reporter and two attorneys from each party.\nSeveral of the potential jurors detailed being sexually assaulted or harassed in the past. They were asked if their experience would prevent them from making an impartial judgment, and most said no.\nThe majority said they have received sexual harassment training as mandated by their employers. And many said they had seen the hotel surveillance video obtained by CNN that allegedly shows Combs physically assaulting Ventura. CNN’s copy of the video will not be used as evidence in the trial, but it’s possible the original footage will be discussed or shown.\nOne potential juror is a photo producer at HBO who has worked on series including “The White Lotus” and “The Last of Us.” Her employment at the cabler caused concern among the defense, as a “negative” docuseries about Combs, “The Fall of Diddy,” streamed on Max earlier this year. The judge overruled the defense’s application to excuse the juror, and she is still currently in the pool of potential picks.\nAnother potential juror, a marketing executive at Simon & Schuster, was excused due to her proximity to an upcoming memoir by Al B. Sure!, who in his book lobs allegations of gang stalking and death threats against Combs.\nOne potential juror sparked laughs from the press area when she was lightly grilled on a shoplifting incident when she was 16 years old. (Each person was required to disclose whether they have been convicted of a crime.) The juror said she stole an item from The Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal Studios in Hollywood. She was fined and prevented from returning to the amusement park for one year. Answering a separate question, this juror also owned up to liking an Instagram clip in which a stand-up comedian made a “funny” joke about the hundreds of bottles of baby oil seized from Combs’ property in a raid.\nCombs is facing five counts, including one for racketeering, two for sex trafficking and two for transportation to engage in prostitution. If he is convicted on any or all counts, Combs could spend the rest of his life in prison.\nSince 2023, the music mogul has been hit with more than 70 civil lawsuits accusing him of sexual misconduct ranging from rape to sex trafficking. Those lawsuits are separate from the federal trial, which will likely feature testimony from high-profile figures such Ventura and other alleged victims whose names have yet to be revealed.\nFederal prosecutors say they have interviewed more than 50 witnesses and recovered evidence from over 100 laptops, cellphones and other electronic devices that paint Combs as a serial abuser who led a vast criminal network held together by assistants, security guards and other employees who kept quiet for years. The charges in the indictment stem from alleged crimes that span from 2004 to 2024.

CBS has bowed out of hosting a presentation, opting for smaller events in multiple cities. ABC and NBC are part of larger pitches for parent companies Disney and Comcast. Amazon and Netflix have joined the parade.\nNo matter who’s in and who’s out, upfronts week is still an annual mile marker and a time for every network to take stock. Below, Variety breaks down the hits, misses and needs of the major players as they tubthump their upcoming lineups.\nPopular on Variety\nABC/Hulu\n–HITS\nABC is fueling the “Broadcast’s back!” narrative with the success of procedural whodunit “High\nPotential,” starring Kaitlin Olson, as well as the growing drama “Will Trent,” about to enter Season 4. In comedy, the net is relying on a familiar face in Tim Allen, whose “Shifting Gears” has been given another race around the primetime track. Hulu, meanwhile, is big on Sterling K. Brown’s “Paradise,” also renewed for a second season.\n–MISSES\nOn the bubble is the Ryan Murphy medical ship show “Doctor Odyssey,” which hasn’t yet learned its fate. The Alphabet web airs the fewest scripted shows of the major broadcasters, so it has less waiting for an answer.\n–NEEDS\nABC’s only pure comedies for next season will be “Abbott Elementary” and “Shifting Gears,” leaving the network short of laughs. And although Hulu is positioned as more of a prestige player, it needs to find its own elevated procedural before it gets left in the streaming dust.\nAmazon\n–HITS\nBased on critical acclaim and Amazon’s self-reported viewership plus Nielsen streaming numbers, Prime Video’s biggest series include “Reacher,” “The Boys” and spinoff “Gen V,” “Thursday Night Football,” “Fallout,” “Cross” and “The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power.”\n–MISSES\nThe Russo brothers’ pricey “Citadel” has been a big disappointment. Amazon has also pulled the plug on ad-supported streamer Freevee.\n–NEEDS\nFollowing the exit of Amazon MGM Studios chief Jen Salke, industry watchers are waiting to see whether Amazon starts making changes. While the streamer is all over action and fantasy, lately it’s lacking in the comedy department.\nCBS\n–HITS\nCBS has renewed most of its slate, including popular freshman shows “Matlock” and “George\n& Mandy’s First Marriage.” It also has locked in a two-season renewal for hit comedy “Ghosts,” which\nwill bring it to Season 6. CBS has found a sweet spot with weekly procedurals with a dramedy bent, such\nas “Elsbeth.” And the network has ordered multiple expansions of existing franchises, including “Boston Blue,” “CIA” and “Sheriff Country.”\n–MISSES\nCBS canceled multi-cam comedy “Poppa’s House” after one season. It also axed “FBI: International,” “FBI: Most Wanted” and “The Equalizer” (after five seasons).\n–NEEDS\nCBS is lacking in pure comedies. “The Neighborhood” is ending with its eighth season. Beyond that “Ghosts,” “George & Mandy’s First Marriage” and “DMV” will be the only laffers on the schedule\nFox\n–HITS\nFox is upping its dosage on medical drama “Doc,” leading to a 22-episode renewal. On the comedy side, the network remains bullish on in-house half-hours “Animal Control” and “Going Dutch.” In unscripted, everything Gordon Ramsay is golden.\n–MISSES\nThings are looking tough for “Rescue HISurf,” as well as “Alert: Missing Persons Unit” and “The Cleaning Lady.” Anthology series “Accused” is on the bubble, but will likely score a pickup.\n–NEEDS\nFox has no shortage of animation (including the return of “American Dad!”) and unscripted; expect the network to pick up at least two new dramas to firm up its hourlong strategy and capitalize on the success of “Doc.”\nNBCUniversal\n–HITS\n“Saturday Night Live” dove into its 50th season with several specials and a three-hour anniversary event, which scored a whopping 14.8 million viewers. NBC also drew in sizable audiences with new titles like nature doc “The Americas” and Reba McEntire’s “Happy’s Place,” which has been renewed. On Peacock, “Love Island USA” Season 6 was a hit, and a spinoff is set for this summer.\n–MISSES\nDespite the streaming love for “Suits,” reviews of “Suits LA” were largely negative, and the only NBC drama with a smaller linear audience was “Grosse Pointe Garden Society.”\n–NEEDS\nPeacock is still struggling for attention. Even its strongest originals are often overlooked, and its\nlibrary titles see more viewers on Netflix.\nNetflix\n–HITS\nNetflix has extracted international megahits like South Korea’s “Squid Game” and Spain’s “Money Heist.” And it has turned mid-budget original dramas like “Baby Reindeer” and “Adolescence” into global phenomena. It’s also a leader in social experiment and dating shows like “Love Is Blind.”\n–MISSES\n–“Pulse,” the streamer’s first medical procedural, failed to capture the zeitgeist. “Zero Day,” starring Robert De Niro, landed with a thud. And “The Electric State,” the Russo brothers’ sci-fi film with a budget exceeding $300 million, was a bomb.\n–NEEDS\nNetflix needs spinoffs. It has struggled to develop long-lasting franchises at the caliber of licensed content like “The Walking Dead” and “The Big Bang Theory.”\nWarner Bros. Discovery\n–HITS\nMedical drama “The Pitt” has revived hopes for shows that drop episodes weekly, while HBO’s\n“Hacks” and “The Last of Us” are getting new attention in their current seasons — and will support\nads on certain tiers of Max.\n–MISSES\nHigh-profile comedy “The Franchise” was axed after just one season and “Bookie” after two.\n–NEEDS\nThe Warner upfront story in 2025 will hinge on sports. After a decades-long stint telecasting regular-season NBA games on TNT, Warner will cede its rights, with NBCU and Amazon taking new positions with the league. Ad buyers and analysts expect a significant transfer of ad dollars that even the buzziest scripted hit won’t prevent.","extracted_keywords":["season","comedy","network","misses","drama","week","shows","ad","streamer","time"]}

{"url":"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/06/sport/lindsey-vonn-return-to-skiing-spt-intl","title":"Lindsey Vonn says she proved to herself and her doubters that ‘I deserve to be here’ after skiing return | CNN","extracted_core_text":"In a CNN Sports exclusive interview, American skier Lindsey Vonn said that she has proved to herself – and her doubters – that she deserves to be back on the World Cup circuit after taking her first podium since coming out of retirement.\nThe 40-year-old came second in the super-G at the World Cup finals in March to become the oldest female Alpine skier to make the podium of a World Cup race – by six years.\nIt was Vonn’s first World Cup podium finish since March 15, 2018 when she placed third in the super-G in Åre, Sweden.\nVonn retired from skiing in February 2019 but announced last year she would be returning to the sport after undergoing a successful partial knee replacement in April 2024.\nIt’s fair to say even Vonn didn’t think she would return to this level of skiing.\n“Never in a million years would I have ever expected to be back here,” she said speaking at the recent Laureus World Sports Awards in Madrid. “I mean, when I saw you last, it was emotional because I was ending my career and that was it.\n“That was the end, and I definitely wish that it hadn’t been the end because I love skiing and it’s always been my passion since I was a kid, but my body was no longer cooperating.\n“Thankfully with this partial knee replacement, now I’m lucky enough to have the chance again – and, hopefully, another Olympics next year.”\nStepping onto that podium was a sliding doors moment in Vonn’s return to the sport she still loves so much.\nShe admitted there were doubts in her own mind about her decision to make a comeback during a brutal season. Vonn said she weighed 20 pounds less than her previous competition weight, wasn’t “nearly as strong as I was before” and had to deal with new equipment, coaches and trainers.\nAt times, Vonn admitted the challenges thrown at her felt “insurmountable” and said “it is hard to quantify” just how important getting back onto the podium was for her belief.\n“I think that it changes everything,” she explained to CNN. “I think there are a lot of people that thought that I would never be back and I would never be successful again – and I think that I proved to myself, and to them, that I still deserve to be here, no matter if I will be 41 at the next Olympics.\n“I cried. I think that (podium) was the hardest I’ve ever cried after a race because it just was so emotional and it meant so much to me – and, actually, I’m going to put it next to my Olympic medal because that’s how much it means to me.\n“I’ve never had so many different variables in one season, and I felt like every weekend it was something new, some new challenge was just being thrown at me. And sometimes, I felt like I was beat down and it was hard to find the motivation because I was doing this because I love ski racing, but at times this season, it felt like it was insurmountable.”\nEven after so many years away from the sport, Vonn said skiing after her comeback still “feels exactly the same.” Her vast experience and knowledge of the tracks, she explained to CNN Sports, helps level the playing field against competitors “half my age” that would enjoy a physical advantage over the quadragenarian skier.\nInitially, Vonn said she wasn’t skiing to “prove anything to anybody” but that changed when she heard “so many negative voices from my peers” during the season.\n“That really hurt me and, by the end, I knew that I could do it for myself, but I also wanted to prove it for every 40 year old woman you know that we are not defined by our age,” Vonn said.\n“We’re defined by our ability and our work ethic, and I worked as hard as I could to be back to where I got to, and that’s why I felt like I needed to do it to prove to women that we could.\n“I love the sport. Like nothing will change it no matter what I do. From the time I was seven years old and I started racing, it’s always been the thing that I just feel the most alive doing.”","extracted_keywords":["podium","year","years","sport","season","skier","skiing","end","super","g"]}

Loved it. An exhilarating adrenaline rush for the head & heart & immersive, awe-inducing stuntacular of the highest order. McQ, [Tom Cruise] & CO have crafted the gold standard – a brilliant, bold actioner for the ages. See it BIG & LOUD.”\nJournalist and BAFTA member Simon Thompson echoed Howard’s glowing review, writing on social media, “[‘Mission: Impossible- The Final Reckoning’] is whip-smart and razor-sharp, this tense eighth entry in one of the most exhilarating franchises of all time is another winner. With sphincter-tightening set pieces, blockbusters do not get much better than this. Cruise & McQuarrie nail it!”\nPopular on Variety\nOffscreen Central’s founder and editor-in-chief, Kenzie Vanunu, praised the film with a small caveat. She wrote, “[‘Mission: Impossible- The Final Reckoning’] is a summer spectacle with nonstop adrenaline and me asking if Tom Cruise is OK the entire movie. There’s a bit too much going on (at all times), but still a good time at the movies!!”\nAfter seven installments across 28 years, “Mission: Impossible 8” brings Cruise’s iconic espionage franchise to a close (at least for the time being). Picking up two months after the events of 2023’s “Dead Reckoning,” the film follows super spy Ethan Hunt as he continues his mission to destroy an all-powerful AI known as “the Entity” before it falls into the wrong hands.\nOther cast members include Hayley Atwell, Hannah Waddingham, Pom Klementieff, Nick Offerman, Shea Whigham, Simon Pegg, Katy O’Brian, Angela Bassett, Ving Rhames and Esai Morales.\nAfter tonight’s press premiere, “MI8” heads to the Cannes Film Festival to screen out of competition on May 14. Cruise and writer-director Christopher McQuarrie will both be in attendance. The splashy world debut will mark Cruise’s third time at the festival, with his first as part of Ron Howard’s 1992 romance “Far and Away” and his second being for “Top Gun: Maverick” in 2022.\nIn total, the “Mission: Impossible” franchise has a lifetime gross of well over $1 billion. The highest earner of the bunch is 2018’s “Fallout,” which is widely considered to be the strongest entry in the franchise.\nCheck out more first reactions below.\n“#MissionImpossible Tom Cruise is truly one of a kind. Loved Final Reckoning.” – Jazz Tangcay @jazzt\n“MISSION IMPOSSIBLE THE FINAL RECKONING is an absolutely captivating send-off to the franchise’s legacy and what Tom Cruise has given to Ethan Hunt. While the first 30-40 minutes is a bit too much of an exposition dump, all the set-pieces that follow are unbeatable.” – Matt Minton @6MattMinton14\n“#MissionImpossibleTheFinalReckoning is an emotional, riveting, & perfect Mission Impossible finale. That feels the most visceral of them all. With pound for pound punches, exhilarating stunts (that might be the best of the franchise), & incredible performances throughout.” – Zach Pope @popetheking\n“#MissionImpossible/#MissionImpossibleTheFinalReckoning is action spectacle brimming with jaw-clenching suspense. That is, when it isn’t drowning in a tsunami of exposition & flashbacks. Really good when it’s firing on all cylinders, but overall, mixed.” – Jeff Nelson @SirJeffNelson\n“WHOA! After a poorly paced first act, #MissionImpossible Final Reckoning revs up the engines for a full speed adrenaline rush to the finale! Incredible stunts, great visuals, and a crazy edge-of-your-seat final sequence! Had a BLAST! THIS IS WHAT ACTION MOVIES ARE ABOUT!” – Leo Rydel @GeeklyGoods\n“MissionImpossibleTheFinalReckoning is the grand crescendo of a franchise built on speed, suspense, and spectacle. Cruise pushes every limit—soaring higher, diving deeper, and racing toward the edge, risking life, limb, and logic in a three-hour blitz of chaos, precision, and pure adrenaline. It’s not just a finale—it’s a full-body experience. Buckle up.” – Landon Johnson @LandonHJohnson","extracted_keywords":["reckoning","franchise","mission","film","adrenaline","time","spectacle","finale","members","press"]}
{"url":"https://variety.com/2025/music/news/asap-rocky-highest-2-lowest-rihanna-assault-trial-1236386576/","title":"Asap Rocky Tells All: Highest 2 Lowest, Rihanna, Assault Trial and More","extracted_core_text":"A$AP Rocky, Movie Star: The Rapper on Method Acting With Denzel Washington, Planning a Film With Rihanna and Being ‘Blessed to Work’ After Assault Trial\nIt’s after midnight in a suite at the W hotel, overlooking New York City’s Union Square, and I’m sitting across from A$AP Rocky as he toys with a half-smoked blunt. There’s a fresh one in the ashtray beside it that one of his assistants recently rolled for him. The armchair I’m perched on is made of stuffed Mickey Mouse toys, a “Tom and Jerry” cartoon is playing on mute in the background and Jefferson Airplane’s psychedelic music is blaring from the stereo.\n“Can you guys bring that chair closer?” Rocky says to one of his crew about my seat, then turns to me. “It’s heavier than it looks.”\nIt’s a gentlemanly gesture from the sweet, Grammy-nominated hip-hop star, who is now as well known for his evolution into subversive fashion icon as he is for his A-list coupling with Rihanna.\nTonight, he’s rocking a pink-and-black tartan kilt with Ray-Bans from his new creative partnership with the sunglasses brand and a camo bomber jacket designed by his AWGE collective. The jacket has a Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, license plate emblazoned on the front; that’s where the Harlem-born Rakim Mayers lived for a stint as a kid, beginning right around the time he started rapping at age 8.\nAs an artist, Rocky dabbles in a little of everything: In addition to the fashion collaborations and his latest gig as co-chair of this year’s Met Gala, his long-awaited fourth album, “Don’t Be Dumb,” is expected to drop sometime this year.\nBut we’re here to talk about Rocky’s Cannes-bound film “Highest 2 Lowest,” Spike Lee’s remake of the Akira Kurosawa crime drama “High and Low” that will see him face off against Denzel Washington. (It will be released by A24 in select theaters Aug. 22 before streaming on Apple TV+ two weeks later.) First, however, Rocky wants to tell me about that time when he was 5 years old and his favorite movie was the 1973 Blaxploitation film “The Mack.”\n“At an assembly on Halloween, I told my teacher that I wanted to be a pimp,” he recalls, diamonds gleaming from the corners of his wide grin. “She took back the microphone and said, ‘Pick another one.’ I said, ‘Uhhh — a ninja?’”\nIn “Highest 2 Lowest,” Rocky isn’t a pimp or a ninja, but instead plays Yung Felon, an aspiring rapper who will stop at nothing to be noticed by Washington’s music mogul. And Rocky’s big moment on the Cannes red carpet will come after he’s fought and won a legal battle that nearly derailed his career and that could have left him in jail for a quarter century.\nThe situation stemmed from a 2021 incident in which Rocky was accused of firing a gun at and grazing the knuckle of his former friend and collaborator Terell Ephron, known as A$AP Relli. Rocky worked on the film as the trial loomed, finding a welcome distraction in acting. “That’s my only escape. That’s why I do it,” he says.\nBut there were moments when art and life intersected. In one scene, Yung Felon faces his own courtroom reckoning, which was “surreal” for Rocky, who knew he’d be in a similar situation in a few months. “That’s why I was able to embody the character so well,” he says, his voice gravelly from weed. “I was able to act like a piece of shit who was going away for a long time but didn’t realize the consequences, because in real life, I knew exactly what the consequences felt like.”\nRocky’s highly publicized trial lasted three weeks before a jury found him not guilty in February. The world watched as a joyful Rocky leapt over a barrier to hug Rihanna and then enfolded his mother and sister in his arms.\nRocky and Rihanna started making music together in 2012, when she was already a mega-star and he was the hot new rapper on the scene. A decade later, they welcomed their first child, RZA Athelston Mayers. His little brother, Riot Rose Mayers, followed in August 2023. Rihanna revealed their third child is on the way just before arriving at the Met Gala.\nProfessionally, the 36-year-old is living out his childhood dream. He’d been a fan of Lee and Washington since watching “Malcolm X” as a kid, so when the director reached out after spotting him in 2018’s “Monster” (which was produced by Lee’s wife, Tonya), Rocky jumped at the opportunity to work with two of his idols. “I was stuck between greatness and greatness.”\nSpike has said that a lot of people get queasy when they’re going up against Denzel. Were you nervous?\nNah, I was born for this. I’m not gonna waste nobody’s time. This is what I do — this is the same approach you would take to making an album or to directing or designing anything: You’ve got to give it your all. People judge you by integrity; that’s how you can measure someone’s principles and morals. If somebody don’t got integrity, and they’re just doing it for the check or the look or the next opportunity, it never works out for them. I promise you. That’s where the phrase “Cheaters never win” comes from. When you cheat yourself in life, you never win in the end.\nDid you read the script before saying yes to Spike?\nI read it. Spike was open to me creating my character. I’m a Method actor — I’ve gotta embody this person. So wearing different hats — like fatherhood and all that other stuff — there’s only so much time you’ve got, right? So I needed this guy to be realistic. His name was MC Microphone Checka — like microphone check, 1, 2, 1, 2 — and I said, “No, he’s Yung Felon.”\nSpike is OK with allowing collective ideas. It was a blessing for him to be so receptive and open-minded to my ideas. He shut down a lot, and he fucked with a lot.\nWhat does Method acting mean to you? What does your preparation look like?\nIt’s being alone in your trailer, looking in the mirror, embodying that person. When you’re not on the set, or when you clock out, you’re still embodying that character. Around the beginning of shooting, my family was still in California, so I got to really be this guy and go home [as him]. When my family finally came to New York in late May, we were almost wrapped, and I had to be in daddy mode. I had to shift back and forth.\nWhat’s it like when Denzel’s acting opposite you?\nIt was like a fucking dream come true. But trust me, it was difficult to not fan the fuck out every millisecond of the fucking duration. It was crazy — it’s fucking Denzel, man. I don’t give a fuck how successful [I am]: I’m always gonna be a student and a fan of certain people, and I’m always going to give them their flowers. I’m never going to be too big to be able to say that I had to hold my composure from not fanning out.\nThe first movies I really loved were “Juice,” “Malcolm X” and “Michael Jackson: Moonwalker.” The first time I saw him, I was watching “Malcolm X.”\nYou went to Cannes 10 years ago with your first movie, “Dope.” What do you remember?\nI didn’t know what to expect. I remember showing up and them telling us, like, “Yo, you know how hard it is to get your shit submitted out here?” And I’m like, “How the fuck do we know if we won or not?” [Laughs] Now I’m more excited because I know the significance. I look forward to seeing the film for the first time with everybody else. I don’t want to see it till then.\nYou know something crazy? Denzel has never actually been to Cannes before.\nGet the fuck outta here!\nYo, Denzel plays more Memphis rap than anybody I know. He’s just like, “Alright, so what you fuck with, kid?” [I’m like,] “Pardon me?” I tried to sound all old school and shit like, “I like Slick Rick…” and he’s like, “Oh, I fuck with Rick, of course. Rick the Ruler.” Then, he started saying Nas lyrics out of nowhere. Then Pac, then DMX, and then he starts talking about the young cats — Moneybagg Yo, NLE Choppa, NBA YoungBoy and these guys. I’m like, “What is this man doing?!” But I’m here for it, like I fuck with it. I was shocked. He’s an OG. You would expect him to listen to Miles Davis all day. Nah, he said, “Throw on NLE Choppa,” [then Washington rapped] “I don’t do drive-bys no more, I walk ’em down.” That’s verbatim. I was like, “This is gonna be lit. It’s on now.”\nYou did some stunts for the role, including getting up on top of a train. Was that really you up there?\nI did. I thought it was lit. I had some bungee wires on, so it was safe. It was action packed, and I was on my Black Tom Cruise shit.\nDo you want to do action movies?\nI’m down for whatever. I think I need to be the new Black James Bond. Like, why not? If we hit the gym, I’ma be aight. Right now I’m in dad mode; you’re gonna have to give me a couple months.\nDo you think you’ll make movies that your kids can see soon?\nI want to do something for my children. Everybody’s doing “Despicable Me” and “SpongeBob” and shit like that. I want to do an original DreamWorks/Pixar-ass film, like “Soul.”\nI like the internet stuff too, like “Gracie’s Corner.” I hate “Cocomelon.” “Cocomelon” is bad for the kids, man, but “Gracie’s” is hittin’. I just hope my kids don’t grow up and think that shit was lame. So, whatever I do, it’s gonna be cool and timeless.\nRihanna’s doing “Smurfs.”\nThat’s gangster. Yo, this shit is jokes though. We both got movies coming out the same year. I didn’t even realize that. Wow! Shout-outs to us — we’ve been working!\nDo you think you’ll ever act together?\nHell, yeah. You saw her acting in my film [the 2022 music video] “D.M.B.” You saw her acting in [my 2013 music video] “Fashion Killa.”\nWhat do you want to do? A romance? A drama?\nSee, I can’t give that away.\nAre you going to direct it?\nMore than likely.\nYou’ve been back in the studio writing some more music. What have you been reflecting on?\nIt’s odd because as I get older, I’m more conscious about how I view myself. Describing my life sounds very braggadocious, and I want to figure out how to say it to where it feels more humble, relatable and sincere, as opposed to just shitting on the next person or making the next person feel down — or just evoking negative shit out of people.\nAre you writing specifically about the trial?\nI’m writing about these past four or five years that I had this over me, and it’s been kind of handicapping me.\nHave you had a harder time trusting people?\nFor sure, it’s a lesson learned. I think I had trust issues for a while now. I can’t necessarily blame it on my last situation. But what I did learn is you’ve gotta accept that everybody’s not good people; you’re not gonna run into a solid person every time. Not everybody’s gonna handle situations like you. Once you accept that you’re not responsible for nobody’s actions but yours … That’s where I’m at — like, yo, focus on your own actions. Because I ain’t perfect. I’m human too, and we all fuck up.\nWe all saw the emotion when you ran into Rihanna’s arms. What do you remember about that moment?\nBeing happy and wanting to get the fuck out that building.\nDid you ever let yourself think that it might not go that way — that the jury might find you guilty?\nYou got to stop yourself from thinking like that. Because that could get the best of you, and you can manifest that energy by mistake. I tried to stay positive at all times. But it was definitely gut-wrenching and nerve-racking, and I was definitely scared for my freedom. I was so thankful that the jury made that decision. I was really thankful for how the judge was respectful and treated me like a first-class citizen. And I was thankful for my team and my lawyer, my family and my mom for being there with me the whole time.\nBut I could say my mom, the jury, my girl and everybody, but all praises and credit has to go to God. I’m a firm believer in prayer, and I was praying the whole time he was reading off the verdict. And my prayers were answered.\nI pray to God for a lot of the things in my life. But I’m not really a religious man; I’m more spiritual.\nIs the trial totally over now?\nIt’s a traumatic situation, but I can’t dwell on it. I got Cannes to go to. I got an album to make. I got fashion shows to do. I got music to make. I got videos. I got sneakers to drop. I got glasses to be the new creative director of. I got children. I got all type of shit. Like, nah, why would I dwell on that dark-ass shit? I talk about it from time to time, but for the most part, I don’t really think about that shit.\nIt’s not tragic to the point where I can’t talk about it, because I’m blessed enough to be here with you in the flesh talking about it. That within itself is the victory and blessing from God for real. I know I sound so religious, but when your back’s against the wall, you tend to call two people: Mommy or God or Jesus. To keep it real with you, I have my mother in my corner and God. [Laughs]\nWhat about your other A24 movie, “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You”?\nThat film is for all the moms across the world. It’s so hard for women. To be a mom, oh my God, the responsibility. Like being a dad, people always kind of look at you for, like, financial responsibility or to fix the sink and fix the car and do this and that. Honestly, man, the way that we look at roles, it’s really traditional. But it’s a bit different when you’re in a position where you barely drive. I ain’t gonna fix no cars, right? I don’t go on my roof — shit, I don’t even know if anything could get stuck on my roof. I haven’t cleaned the gutters, none of that stuff. I’m busy creating some crazy master plans and shit. I’m trying to spend as much time with my little ones when I’m not on phone calls all day.\nI’m blessed to work. With all the circumstances that I’ve been going through, being able to just navigate through life and come out victoriously, I just want that to be an example for guys like me that “Yo, it’s light at the end of the tunnel. You could always take any negative and flip that shit to a positive for real.”\nTell me about the evolution of “Don’t Be Dumb,” the album you’ve got in the works. You’ve already released “Highjack” from it, which got a great response.\nI like to do things that don’t make sense. Nobody would have thought to put [folk musician] Jessica Pratt on that, but I think her voice so angelic. She literally let me write the whole thing, and she just sung it beautifully. She makes me want to be like a secret songwriter; I should probably get into writing folk songs. She’s sick.\nThis fucking album, it represents who I am right now. It’s just I hope that it’s digestible.\nYou watched “The Brutalist” three times.\nIn one sitting. Because I would rewind that shit. I’d get to the middle of it, rewind it back to the middle of it, rewind it again and then watch it from the middle to the end.\nYou watched it because you’re into furniture design?\nThat’s just another one of my loves and passions, man.\nDo you like to go to the movie theater?\nI prefer to go to the cinema — the the-at-er. It’s way better.\nWhat do you love about movies?\nCinema is just a portal to an imagination, depicted by somebody else. You get to see somebody else’s dream. It’s almost like a filmmaker is a God in his own right. You get to dictate your world: you get to dictate the weather, the contrast, the color, the mood, the lighting, the people, the characters. You get to dictate the narration. You can dictate the ending, the plot, the twist, everything. It’s a tool that allows grown-ups and adults to still imagine and pretend.\nGerman expressionism is a big influence in your music right now. What inspires you about that style of art?\nIt equates to hip-hop. You’ve got the war just ending and a whole nation of people that are suppressed and restricted. And nobody’s fucking with them — not the States, not the allies —they’re on their own. Out of all that tragedy — that pain and confusion and war — rose this new art form. There would be no Tim Burton if it wasn’t for that. Film noir derived from German expressionism. And that’s what I try to make: ghetto expressionism. I relate to that personally, because I’m just getting out of whatever the fuck I was going through.\nI heard you played Tim Burton some of the album?\nI was reaching out to my people for years — like, “I need to meet Tim Burton.” But my current team made it happen. He was like, “Yo, come through to Malibu.” I kicked it with him, played him some music.\nWhat did he think?\nHe was fucking with it. But his speakers was ass. He got the cinema speakers; he ain’t got them A$AP Rocky “Don’t Be Dumb” hip-hop speakers.\nIt’s a nice thing to hear when somebody is moved by your work. What’s it like when somebody tells you what you’ve meant to them?\nIt’s like getting the Oscar-Grammy-Emmy-Tony in one. It’s like getting the fucking every music award you could think of at one time.\nIs your dream to one day be an EGOT winner?\nI would be lying if I said no. That’s always been a dream. The more that I do it and it doesn’t happen, it’s just motivation to keep trying and going harder.\nAre we going to see you on Broadway?\nI don’t think so. But that’s what really determines great actors and actresses. If I’m being totally honest, to be a better actor overall, theater is the only way to do that. One of the best, wisest men told me that — Mr. Jeffrey Wright.\nDuring “Highest 2 Lowest,” he was coaching me. I would do something, and he’d be like, “Nah, man, you got to do it like this,” and “Say your line like that.” We would just kick it in the trailer. He would tell me what books to read and show me the old-school shit he used to be in. He’s just an OG like that.\nHe told you theater is the right way to go?\nI don’t think I’m ready. I gotta be in one place, and that’s a lot to commit to.\nYou’re the new creative director for Ray-Ban sunglasses, you’re designing shoes for Puma, you’ve got the clothes with AWGE and you’ve got the music. How are you managing it all?\nIf I had those deals or not, I would still be designing that stuff, still trying to put it out. I look at brands, at collaborations, at everything like manifestation. It’s all about the timing and accepting that what’s meant for you is meant for you, and when it’s not, it’s not. That’s the hardest part.\nHow did you learn how to do that?\nBecause of how down or upset or disappointed I would be if something fell through or didn’t go right. I’m passionate about projects, about deals, about any partnership. My name, integrity and reputation are on the line, so I want to be the same across all endeavors. I want people to say, “That’s an involved and creative brother, like, a creative young man. He has really good ideas.”\nHow does that relate to auditioning for movie roles?\nI auditioned for “Star Wars” — for Lando — and my audition was trash. I was trash that day. My man Childish Gambino [Donald Glover] was a way better Lando than I would’ve provided at that time. And I think he looked a little more like [Billy Dee Williams] than me.\nWould you do it again? Do you dream of wielding a lightsaber?\nHell, yeah.","extracted_keywords":["time","shit","people","music","man","film","album","life","way","fuck"]}

An ancient art dating back to the Han Dynasty, lion dance is more than just a performance for these youths — it's a way for these youths to connect with their heritage and build confidence and a sense of belonging within the community.\nLion dance is a physically demanding art form, requiring immense strength, stamina and coordination. Each evening, practices begin with body-strengthening exercises and martial arts training to prepare for the intricate movements of lion dance. Through this disciplined routine, participants develop resilience and teamwork while mastering the traditional techniques. The training not only hones physical skills but also instills self-discipline and a foundation for personal growth.\nHistorically, lion dance was a male-dominated art form, as it was physically demanding and a taboo, culturally, for women. Today, girls are challenging this tradition by taking up the sport. Several girls — some of whom joined after being inspired by friends or siblings — shared that they got involved because they wanted to learn kung fu or because \"lion dance looks super cool.\" Their participation reflects a broader shift in cultural traditions, evolving to embrace inclusivity while preserving their core essence.\nEast Wind also teaches the cultural significance behind the art form. Annual blessing ceremonies, where new lion heads are welcomed, offer youths a chance to learn rituals that honor their ancestors. Elders guide them in traditions like dotting a lion's eyes with ink, which symbolically awakens the lions to life. These ceremonies deepen the younger generation's connection to their heritage, fostering respect for their history and roots.\nBeyond practices and ceremonies, East Wind nurtures community connections by organizing field trips in nature. These experiences allow youths from immigrant families, who often face financial or time constraints, to explore and bond with their peers. Through these activities, they build lasting friendships while enjoying meaningful interactions with nature.\nLast summer, East Wind opened the Chinatown Community Cultural Center, a dedicated space to preserve and promote the legacy of lion dancing and martial arts through education. By volunteering at the center, youths learn to share their knowledge with visitors and continue advocating for this ancient art. The center aims to ensure that the next generation carries forward these traditions with a sense of cultural pride.\nThrough the traditional folk art of lion dance, these young lions are not only keeping a centuries-old practice alive but also forging meaningful connections to their cultural roots in this dynamic world.","extracted_keywords":["lion","art","youths","dance","folk","form","traditions","ceremonies","dancing","heritage"]}

The independent agency is in charge of investigating and adjudicating complaints about unfair labor practices and protecting U.S. workers' rights to form unions.\nThe lawmakers, who are part of the Congressional Labor Caucus, wrote the letter in light of news first reported by NPR, that a whistleblower inside the IT department of the NLRB says DOGE may have removed sensitive labor data and exposed NLRB systems to being compromised.\n\"These revelations from the whistleblower report are highly concerning for a number of reasons,\" the lawmakers wrote in the letter to Cowen. \"If true, these revelations describe a reckless approach to the handling of sensitive personal information of workers, which could leave these workers exposed to retaliation for engaging in legally protected union activity.\"\nThe letter refers to an official whistleblower disclosure made by Daniel Berulis, a cloud administrator in the IT department of the NLRB, who also spoke to NPR in multiple interviews.\nIn his disclosure, Berulis shared that he initially became concerned in March when members of President Trump's Department of Government Efficiency initiative arrived at the agency and demanded high-level access to the systems without their activities being logged. Those fears escalated after he tracked a large chunk of data leaving the agency at the same time as many security controls and auditing tools were turned off, the disclosure continues.\nUltimately, Berulis became concerned that DOGE, which is effectively led by Trump adviser and billionaire CEO Elon Musk, could have accessed sensitive internal information about ongoing investigations into U.S. companies, witness affidavits and even corporate secrets. The alleged insecure practices and removal of data could also create vulnerabilities for criminal hackers or foreign adversaries to exploit, Berulis explained in his official disclosure.\nIt's unclear how that data would be relevant to DOGE, whose stated mission is to make the government more efficient and slash federal spending. One of the lawmakers' central questions was about why DOGE would have needed access to internal NLRB systems to reduce government spending.\n\"Given DOGE's desire to access sensitive information at other federal agencies with a focus on payment information, it is unclear why DOGE would be interested in NLRB data that has nothing to do with federal payments,\" the lawmakers wrote.\nThe lawmakers were also concerned about the potential conflicts of interest for DOGE leaders like Musk who might benefit from having access to sensitive labor data at a time when the NLRB has ongoing cases involving Musk's companies including SpaceX and Tesla. \"Furthermore, Elon Musk, who Donald Trump has repeatedly said is 'in charge' of DOGE, has a number of cases before the Board and is also pursuing several lawsuits to challenge the constitutionality of the Board itself,\" they wrote.\nThe members urged NLRB leadership to take immediate action to answer questions about DOGE's alleged access, given the fact that \"DOGE officials were again recently present at NLRB headquarters\" and will be detailed part-time at the agency over the next couple of months, according to a letter sent to NLRB employees last week.\nThe NLRB told NPR that they have no records of DOGE's early March visit, did not grant DOGE official access to its systems, and never received an official request from DOGE to access the systems. Meanwhile, the NLRB said there was an internal review of a potential breach inside the agency after Berulis raised his concerns, and that NLRB officials ruled out a breach. However, Berulis has argued that the forensic evidence he has presented warrants further investigation by agencies with additional investigative resources.\nThe revelations from Berulis come at a time when there are over a dozen court cases alleging that DOGE staffers mishandled sensitive government data across different agencies, ranging from the Treasury Department to the Social Security Administration.\nHave information or evidence to share about DOGE's access to data inside the federal government?

{"url":"https://www.npr.org/transcripts/nx-s1-5377445","title":"What has DOGE done in Trump’s first 100 days? : NPR","extracted_core_text":"JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:\nAs we near 100 days of the second Trump administration, we also near 100 days of DOGE. The ad hoc Department of Government Efficiency team is one of the defining initiatives of President Trump's term so far. DOGE has not really delivered on its promised savings, efficiency or transparency goals in meaningful ways. It has amassed unprecedented power over sensitive personal data the government maintains. NPR's Stephen Fowler has been tracking this. Hi.\nSTEPHEN FOWLER, BYLINE: Hey there.\nSUMMERS: So, Stephen, let's start here - is the federal government more efficient with DOGE?\nFOWLER: Not really, Juana. I mean, there hasn't been meaningful progress on DOGE's mandate to cut government spending or improve how it operates. Billionaire Elon Musk's vision of taking a chainsaw to the multitrillion-dollar budget has hit repeated snags. Many of DOGE's efforts to push agencies to fire workers or shut down programs have been blocked by the courts and been unpopular in the court of public opinion. And that work has been largely done in secret with countless anecdotes of inefficiency dominating reporting we've done, like probationary employees that were fired, rehired and fired again, people told to return to office work with shortages of desks, internet bandwidth and even toilet paper and claims to save money by cutting contracts that made things more efficient.\nSUMMERS: OK, I want to zoom in on savings here. One of the key planks of DOGE was this intent to cut a trillion dollars of federal spending this budget year. So tell us, how's it going?\nFOWLER: Well, the biggest cut so far has been to their own savings goals. A few weeks ago, Musk revised that savings estimate down to $150 billion. Even then, there's little evidence that that is achievable. One, the federal government spends more money than it brings in. In fact, Treasury Department data says spending is up 10% from this time last year. And two, as we've reported, DOGE's savings tracker on their website is riddled with errors, inaccuracies and opaque methodology. For example, I looked over the weekend, and the five biggest savings claims for contracts includes one contract that was never awarded, one that was already terminated and one contract that doesn't seem to be canceled at all.\nSUMMERS: So another thing DOGE has done is work to combine government data that doesn't normally go together. How controversial has that project been?\nFOWLER: DOGE has amassed this unprecedented power over the most sensitive data the government collects on Americans and from Americans like Social Security numbers and bank accounts and other things that are supposed to be kept private. A small number of engineers and others with ties to Musk have been using that data access to connect the dots to help policy aims, especially around immigration. There's been a push to share immigration-related data from the IRS, Social Security Administration and other agencies to help aid in the Trump administration's deportation push. The Department of Homeland Security also announced last week that DOGE helped overhaul an immigration database that will serve as, quote, \"a single, reliable source for verifying noncitizen status nationwide.\" There's also been more than a dozen court cases, Juana, where judges have repeatedly expressed concern over who has that data and how it's being used, and the ways in which it's being shared potentially violates federal law and risks exposure of that data outside of its intended use.\nSUMMERS: Stephen, we know that Elon Musk has said that he will step back from DOGE in the coming weeks. So tell us how might that change DOGE's work?\nFOWLER: Well, in many ways, it's not going to change things. I mean, Musk has been the face of DOGE, but there's been his allies that have been working in these federal agencies. They are now employees of the agencies. They are still working with the agencies. They'll be the ones carrying out the mission. They're not going anywhere anytime soon. President Trump gave a deadline of July 4, 2026, for DOGE's work. But even after that work's done, there are long-term changes that would be hard to unwind - things like ending scientific research funding, reducing foreign policy footprint for America and the loss of institutional knowledge from some of the hundred thousand workers so far that have been fired or chosen to leave the federal government.\nSUMMERS: NPR's Stephen Fowler in Atlanta. He is part of the team of reporters across NPR's newsroom covering government restructuring and the impact of DOGE. Stephen, thank you.\nFOWLER: Thank you.\nCopyright © 2025 NPR. All rights reserved.

Responding to those in the skiing world who are questioning her comeback, Vonn, in a post on X, said, “You know, I’m getting pretty tired of people predicting negative things about my future. It’s enough now. … Did they all become doctors and I missed it, because they talk like they know more than the best doctors in the world.”\nIn an interview Thursday with Eurosport’s Viktoria Rebensburg, Vonn said, “I think that’s something that bothers me – is that people think that I’m taking more risks than anyone else. But I know downhill probably better than almost anyone out there.”\nVonn, who had retired from competitive skiing in 2019 after 18 years on the World Cup circuit, recently competed in lower-level events in Copper Mountain, Colorado, in order to gain eligibility to compete at World Cup races.\nShe will race in two super-G events in St. Moritz – where she has previously won five World Cup races and secured ten podiums – with one race on Saturday and the other on Sunday.\n“Things haven’t changed now that I’ve had a knee replacement,” Vonn said to Eurosport, which is a division of Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), which is the parent company of CNN.\n“My doctors have cleared me. They are very confident in what I’m doing. I wouldn’t be doing it if it was a reckless idea.\n“I think a lot of people have a lot of wild ideas about how crazy it is what I’m doing, but I’m not a dumb person.\n“I’ve talked to the best doctors in the world, and they’ve cleared me to do this.”\nAt Vonn’s age, she would be entering unchartered territory should she reach the podium or win. In October, Federica Brignone became the oldest woman to win a World Cup race at 34 years, 104 days.\nJohan Clarey has the record in men’s skiing for the oldest podium finisher at age 42.\nDidier Cuche is the oldest men’s winner, at 37.\n“I feel like I’m in my early 20s,” Vonn told Eurosport. “It feels great. It’s like a whole new world for me. My goals, I’m trying to take it step by step. I’m trying not to get ahead of myself. I know that it’s going to take a little time to get back into it.\n“I know that I’m skiing well. But I haven’t raced in almost six years. It’s going to take a second. But I think I can get back to a similar level where I to what I was before.”\nVonn recently posted on Instagram that she’s rebuilding herself.\n“Not just my knee, but as a person,” Vonn said in her post. “I am so stronger today than I ever was before. I believe in myself. No matter my age or my history. No matter what people may say, I am doing this for me. I don’t need to prove anything to anyone. I don’t need the spotlight or attention. I simply want to do something that brings me joy and to share that joy with my family, friends, team and all of you.\n“I am not holding on to the past, I am embracing the future. Call me naive, but I believe in the impossible. Because it’s only impossible until someone does it.”\nVonn told Eurosport she thinks she’ll have another knee replacement “at some point in the future” because of her age, “but that would happen whether I skied or didn’t ski,” she said.\n“Any time you’re skiing downhill, or honestly any alpine events, you always take a risk,” Vonn said. “It doesn’t matter who you are. Anything can happen. That’s the risk that we all take.”\nVonn’s haul of 82 World Cup wins puts her third on the all-time list behind Sweden’s Ingemar Stenmark on 86 and compatriot Mikaela Shiffrin on 99.\nBut this isn’t about chasing Shiffrin, Vonn says.\n“I’m not here to prove anything to anyone,” Vonn said. “I’m really happy with what I achieved in my career. I’m the No. 2 most successful women’s skier of all time. That’s perfectly fine with me.”","extracted_keywords":["age","knee","world","people","doctors","time","replacement","skiing","future","years"]}

Utopia helped release “Megalopolis” in the U.S. last year alongside American Zoetrope and Lionsgate and plans to release “Megadoc” theatrically this fall.\nThe documentary was produced by Tara Li-An and James Mockoski.\nPopular on Variety\nPer the description, “Megadoc” began from a chance encounter, sparked by an email between two old friends that resulted in Coppola inviting Figgis to the “Megalopolis” set in the lead up to the first day of principal photography and “granting him permission to document whatever he wished.” Armed with a small camera and crew throughout the entire shoot, Figgis’s unrestricted access to the production gave way to “Megadoc,” a “unique look into the creative process of one of the most revered directors of all time, and behind the curtain of the most ambitious film of his career.”\n“The great filmmaker Mike Figgis shot the making of ‘Megalopolis’ as he saw it,” said Coppola. “Interestingly, there are many interpretations of what really happened and it’s all in the documentary although the documentary doesn’t always say which is what … it is for the viewer to behold and interpret.”\nVariety understands that “Megadoc” doesn’t simply look to put a glossy shine on “Megalopolis” and Coppola, but digs into the good/bad of it all as well. But it’s unknown how far that might extend, and whether it would include the on-set misconduct allegations made against Coppola, the trailer that was removed for using fake quotes or the critical backlash the film received.\n“Francis gave me access to everything, including the amazing archive material he’s accumulated of the many readings of the script as it went from one version to another. I was more or less free to go where I wanted,” Figgis said. “The cast were open about the working situation and how they were dealing with the idiosyncrasies of Francis and his very individual working methods. What a privilege to be a witness to such a moment in film history.”\nThe “Megadoc” deal was negotiated directly between Utopia and Figgis’ independent production company, Red Mullet. Robert Schwartzman of Utopia said in a statement,\n“Eleanor Coppola’s iconic feature documentary, ‘Hearts of Darkness,’ gave audiences an incredible look and access to the making of ‘Apocalypse Now’; a film that, in time, became highly regarded as one of the finest cinematic experiences of the era and beyond.,” said Robert Schwartzman of Utopia. “Mike Figgis’s ‘Megadoc’ will be that to ‘Megalopolis,’ opening up to audiences a behind-the-scenes journey spanning 40 years, where we will watch one of the greatest filmmakers at work.”","extracted_keywords":["documentary","making","film","access","year","day","feature","filmmaker","scenes","production"]}

A superstar of his era. He’s third on the all-time list of major winners with 11 behind only Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods.\nHagen won the PGA Championship a total of five times – the same record tally as Nicklaus – with four of those titles coming consecutively between 1924 and 1927, but it’s what happened after his 1925 triumph – exactly 100 years ago – that led to him facing a rather uncomfortable truth over many years.\nAfter his victory at the Olympia Fields Country Club near Chicago, Hagen would later reveal he lost the hefty yet highly prestigious trophy while out celebrating after purportedly giving it to a taxi driver to take back to his hotel; the trophy never made it to its destination.\nNow, just imagine having to win a major golf tournament to keep a terrible secret safe – and then to keep winning it. That was Hagen’s new reality.\nA year later, Hagen showed up to defend his title at the 1926 tournament without the Wanamaker Trophy. Such was the American’s dominance in this era, nobody had seriously questioned where the trophy actually was, but after a third-straight win, the question was indeed finally asked. The champ though was unfazed. He brushed it off, saying he had no intention of relinquishing his title. “I will win it anyway, so I didn’t bring it,” he added.\nTrue to his word, he won again a year later, but all good things eventually come to an end and his incredible win streak would finally be over at the 1928 tournament following defeat to his compatriot Leo Diegel. At that point, Hagen knew the game was up and he had to come clean.\nA duplicate Wanamaker Trophy had been made in 1926, but as for the original, it did mysteriously show up six years after it had first disappeared ahead of the 1931 PGA Championship.\nSome reports back in the early 1930s suggested the Wanamaker was found in the Detroit golf factory that made Hagen’s equipment.\nThe original 1916 trophy is named after department store heir Rodman Wanamaker who was instrumental in the creation of the PGA of America.\nThat original is now displayed at the PGA of America’s new home in Texas, meaning it’s the duplicate that the champion gets to keep for one year. Each winner though does get to permanently hold on to a replica, which is about 10 percent smaller than the original.\nWalter Hagen was not just one of the best players of all time, he was also the ultimate showman and entertainer; “I never wanted to be a millionaire, I just wanted to live like one,” he once famously said.\nAn undisputed legend of the sport, the Haig’s impact on golf is immense. In addition to his 11 majors, he also won 45 times on the PGA Tour. He won the US Open twice and he was the first American-born golfer to win the Open Championship going on to win the famed Claret Jug four times. He played a prominent role in the development of the Ryder Cup too serving as America’s team captain the first six times the event was held.\nWalter Hagen’s legacy is both enduring and inspiring. It’s also one indelibly intertwined with one of the most iconic trophies in sports history.","extracted_keywords":["golf","year","times","trophy","title","time","years","tournament","inches","sport"]}

French Olympic planners plot to end the invasion of the English language | CNN","extracted_core_text":"When Paris clinched the race to host the 2024 Olympic Games, it may have been in part thanks to a slogan that embodied the Olympic spirit: “Made for sharing.”\nBut for French officials, that generosity doesn’t extend to the Games’ official languages.\n“The official languages of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) are French and English – in that order,” said l’Académie Française, the pre-eminent council for matters pertaining to the French language.\nThe 2024 Olympics continues a tradition of an evolving roster of sports, with surfing, breakdancing and sport climbing among the recent additions. With them come a flock of terms that are foreign to the French language.\nFor some French-language purists, it’s too much to bear to revert to English to compliment surfers on their ‘noseriding’ – standing on the front of the board – or to mention a breakdancer’s ‘cypher’ – the circle that athletes dance in. They’ve decided they need a solution ‘à la française.’\nThe French government has created a college of experts devoted to promoting the national language, in conjunction with several Olympic federations.\n“The translation of tricks will be crucial,” said Daniel Zielinski, a high-ranking official for the French language in sport and spokesperson of the committee. “Because when you are a [French] athlete or a viewer, watching rollerblading or skateboarding, you don’t understand anything the specialists are saying.”\nDuring their first meeting last January, the college agreed to start working on its first two terms: ‘breakdancing’ and when dancers ‘freeze.’ Various translations have been suggested so far, including ‘le breaking’ and ‘la frise.’\n“Once a term is made official, it becomes mandatory,” said Zielinski.\nThe organization, composed of experts and intellectuals from different fields, will meet periodically over the next couple of years to identify and define new sports terms.\nThe IOC, whose role is to supervise and monitor the organization of the Games, is not involved in the project.\n“It is not for the IOC to comment on a governmental initiative but we applaud the objective of trying to make sport as accessible to as many people as possible through language,” the committee told CNN.\nThe invasion of Franglais\nThe French battle against the influence of other languages isn’t new.\nIn 1994, the Toubon law was passed, mandating the use of French in all government publications, contracts and advertisements. Yet it contained several loopholes, which allow brands and companies to extensively use English.\nAs a result, anglicisms are becoming more prominent, including made-up words such as ‘footing’ for ‘running’ and ‘baskets’ for ‘sneakers.’\nJulie Neveux, linguistics professor at Sorbonne University in Paris, said anglicisms are “sometimes estimated at just under 5% of the current lexicon, but they are disturbing because they show that we follow an economic and cultural model other than our own.”\nThey are particularly present in sports competitions and events, during which athletes from around the world are used to communicating in English.\n“Sport was one of the first areas to be globalized,” said sports historian Michael Attali. “This phenomenon has imposed English as the official language.”\nAttali added the media and sports federations are also to blame, as they relay anglicisms by not “making the effort of translating them.”\nA pointless battle?\nDespite their best efforts, no committee has successfully prevented English from infiltrating everyday language. By the time French officials have agreed on a translation and its definition, the English version has already spread throughout the nation.\n“Similar assemblies have been put in place in the past, but nothing has changed so far,” said Attali. “In soccer, we still use terms such as ‘corner’ for corner kick, instead of its official translation, and that will not stop anytime soon.”\nOnce the sole official language of the Olympics, the language of Proust and Dumas has taken a back seat as the use of English has soared in recent decades.\nIn protest, the French government has sent a delegate to each Olympics since the 1996 Atlanta Games, tasked with assessing the place of the French language at the event.\nHowever, athletes and commentators alike have continued using English terminology.\nIn her report on the PyeongChang 2018 Olympic Games, former delegate Fleur Pellerin noted “the presence of the French language (had) been insufficient on the competition field.”\n“The growing importance of English as an international language of communication and work, the preponderant influence of English-speaking funders and elected officials in international sport and in the Olympic Games, and the insufficient coordination of the French-speaking sport community contribute to explaining this evolution,” read the report.\nSpokesperson Daniel Zielinski says he is not “dogmatic” when it comes to this new committee’s potential. He only hopes their initiatives will “encourage watching and practicing those sports, for those who want to do them.”\nThe French exit\nIf English is now the preferred language of athletes and commentators, French has had a long-lasting influence on the world of sport.\nBallet remains flooded with French words, such as ‘pas de bourré,’ ‘arabesque’ and ‘chassé.’ At the beginning of every fencing match, the French imperative ‘Allez’ – meaning ‘Go’ – is used by referees.\nEven the term ‘sport’ originates from the Old French word ‘desport,’ meaning ‘leisure.’\n“There are far fewer anglicisms in French than there are French words in English,” said Neveux, adding these exchanges should not be seen “as a threat.”\n“All living languages exist by borrowing from each other, it is an asset. Languages only exist thanks to their impurity.”\nBut, for some, this impurity is perceived as a danger to the French identity.\nAs the official guardian of the French language, the Académie Française continues to closely keep track of the number of English words that have crossed the border.\nTheir website has a section dedicated to “Neologisms and Anglicisms,” in which they advise against improper English terms like ‘trials’ as major competitions approach.\n“The French language conveys the French soul,” Jean-Marie Rouart, author and member of the Académie Française, told CNN. “It conveys at the same time French universalism, tolerance and a concern of beauty and aesthetics.”\nThe Académie is a key member of the Olympic language committee. But whether the project ultimately succeeds – or fails – its mission of eradicating English words in the French sporting arena, Rouart has little hope for the language he has spent decades defending.\n“In twenty years, French will be a dead language and will be studied the way Latin and Greek are now,” he said.","extracted_keywords":["language","sport","sports","languages","terms","committee","words","anglicisms","officials","government"]}

You can lose and actually be a loser because you lost, but still also be a winner.\n“It’s just what you do on a daily basis. Some days you lose and some days you win, and you can go through all of that and have the most turbulent times and still rise again tomorrow.\n“It’s not so scary to fail, especially because I failed because I was trying so hard – maybe too hard.\n“And maybe after 12 years in a ski career, I should have known how hard to push and not go over that limit, but I pushed harder because I wanted it and that’s not really an excuse.\n“I’m going to go out again and try next time, but fewer people will be watching,” she laughs.\nAfter she crashed out of the slalom, the sight of Shiffrin sitting at the side of the slope, her arms on her knees and her head bowed, became one of the enduring images of Beijing 2022.\nAs one of the greatest to ever put on a pair of skis, Shiffrin has become accustomed to success throughout her career, which includes gold medals from Sochi and Pyeongchang.\nHowever, after suffering her second DNF in the space of three days in Beijing, Shiffrin says she just needed a moment with her thoughts on the hill.\n“It’s maybe not as insightful as you might hope,” she says when asked about what she was thinking about in that moment.\n“I was feeling cold and I sat down on the snow and I was immediately like: ‘That was a bad, bad idea because now my bum is also cold and wet’ – and I felt really trapped in there.\n“I just wanted to get as far out of the line of vision for the other athletes who were still racing and starting in less than a minute, and I was hoping I was far enough to the side because I went out so soon, they were literally in the start.\n“I’m like: ‘Oh my gosh, Paula [Moltzan], my teammate, she’s coming pretty soon. Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, she’s going to see me, she’s going to freak out. I just need to get over here and then I need to be still as a stone.’”\nIn the days that followed her third DNF, Shiffrin posted some of the abusive messages she had received on social media during her time in Beijing.\n“Got what you deserved,” “dumb blonde” and “dumb b*tch” were among some of the messages, with others telling her to retire from the sport.\nShiffrin admitted in her Instagram post that she had started to question why she keeps coming back to skiing, but now says the thought of being back atop the podium is driving her to get back out onto the slopes.\n“It’s actually a lot of the things I fear the most about myself,” she says. “That I have lost my touch in the sport, that I should give it up … they’re the worst things you think about yourself, yet somebody else just finds a way to push those buttons.\n“And you’re like: ‘I want to argue with you, but I just don’t even know what to say.’ I saw one comment today [that said], ‘You’re just a loser and you didn’t contribute anything.’ I’m like: ‘I know!’” Shiffrin laughs.\n“I realize that and I am a loser, but I’ve also been a winner and I think I can win again.”","extracted_keywords":["career","days","slalom","loser","skier","years","winner","time","moment","messages"]}

Kaplan and acting general counsel William Cowen and shared with NPR by two NLRB employees at regional offices who are not authorized to speak publicly, said two DOGE representatives would be detailed to the agency from the General Services Administration \"part-time for several months\" and would largely work remotely.\n\"The representatives have requested information about agency operations but asked us to remove any personally identifiable information from documents we provide,\" the email reads. \"Consistent with the President's Executive Order and applicable laws, the Agency will comply with DOGE's requests for access and information.\"\nIt's unclear why DOGE would need access to agency files that contain personally identifiable information to complete its mission of improving efficiency, outside of employment records for potential reductions in force. The agency publishes publicly available annual performance and accountability reports and budget justifications that former NLRB members told NPR would likely be sufficient in looking for ways to cut costs.\nThe NLRB employees in the regional offices who shared the email told NPR that the atmosphere at work is chaotic. \"There is panic among the employees,\" said one of the employees. \"My office has been in turmoil since this afternoon's email … people are concerned about the data.\"\n\"DOGE coming into the building with access to systems prior to an investigation is a major red flag — what are they doing now? Someone needs to step in, isolate the systems, and conduct an investigation,\" said Andrew Bakaj of the nonprofit Whistleblower Aid, who is Berulis's attorney.\nTim Bearese, the NLRB's acting press secretary, did not respond to NPR's questions about DOGE visiting the agency. Earlier this week, Bearese denied that NLRB granted DOGE access to its systems and said DOGE had not requested access to the agency's systems. Bearese said the agency conducted an investigation after Berulis raised his concerns but \"determined that no breach of agency systems occurred.\"\nOn Tuesday, White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly said in a statement to NPR, \"It is months-old news that President Trump signed an Executive Order to hire DOGE employees at agencies and coordinate data sharing. Their highly-qualified team has been extremely public and transparent in its efforts to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse across the Executive Branch, including the NLRB.\" Wednesday's email also referenced an earlier communication to NLRB staff, that \"the Agency had no official contact with any DOGE personnel.\"\nDespite the claims made by agency officials this week, Berulis' whistleblower disclosure shared with Congress and other federal overseers provides evidence of DOGE's access and activities, including the creation and deletion of an account in NLRB's cloud systems called \"DogeSA_2d5c3e0446f9@nlrb.microsoft.com.\"\nBerulis noticed a chunk of data leaving the NLRB NxGen case management system, then a large spike in outbound traffic leaving the network. The NxGen system contains personal information about union members or employees voting to join a union, witness testimony in ongoing cases and trade secrets and proprietary data about companies involved in the agency's investigations. Access to that data is protected by numerous federal laws, including the Privacy Act.\nSeveral companies run by Elon Musk, the billionaire Trump ally and de facto head of DOGE, have cases before the NLRB — as do Musk's competitors. His SpaceX company is also part of a lawsuit seeking to have the courts declare the agency's structure as unconstitutional.\nAfter NPR reported on the whistleblower disclosure, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee called for an investigation into DOGE's access to the NLRB.\nU.S. Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., expressed concern that DOGE \"may be engaged in technological malfeasance and illegal activity,\" in a letter sent to two independent labor watchdogs.\nThe letter asks the inspectors general to answer a number of questions regarding ways DOGE may have potentially violated federal law, including any NLRB networks DOGE staffers had access to and what records of DOGE's work within NLRB systems exist.\nBerulis' whistleblower's disclosure is the latest in a pattern of legal questions around DOGE's virtually unfettered access to personal and financial data kept in different databases across the federal government, and concerns about what DOGE is doing with that data.\nIn more than a dozen federal court cases, DOGE and the Trump administration have largely failed to give consistent and clear answers about who has access to the data and how that access complies with privacy and cybersecurity protections in place.\nHave information or evidence to share about DOGE's access to data inside the federal government?

He also, without evidence, dismissed protests against Tesla as being \"paid for,\" and said that demand for the company's vehicles remains strong despite a sharp decline in sales.\nTesla's quarterly earnings report, released about an hour before the call, showed that the company's net income plunged by 71% year-over-year and that revenue from selling cars dropped by 20%.\nAnalysts had been expecting bad news: They already knew Tesla's deliveries in the first quarter of 2025 were down 13% from a year ago. That was the company's biggest-ever quarterly decline in sales. Meanwhile, electric vehicle sales in general rose 7% over the same timeframe.\nMusk and other Tesla analysts emphasized that multiple factors affected those poor sales, including the fact that some customers may have been waiting to buy a Model Y as the popular vehicle went through a refresh. But there's evidence that the destruction of Tesla's brand among Democrats and liberals — who remain far more likely than Republicans and conservatives to be shopping for an EV — is also a major factor.\nMusk's controversial political work has significantly harmed Tesla's brand reputation, according to multiple surveys. Tesla showrooms have been the sites of repeated protests over the last few months. In some cases, vandals have struck Tesla vehicles. And the sense that driving a Tesla now signals support for Musk and President Trump has haunted some current Tesla drivers and driven some EV shoppers away from the brand.\nMusk dismissed that, saying that \"absent macro issues, we don't see any reduction in demand.\"\nWithout citing evidence, he attributed blowback against his DOGE work to \"those who were receiving the wasteful and fraudulent dollars,\" saying that protests against Tesla are \"paid for.\"\nTesla Takedown, the group that is organizing the protests, wrote in an emailed statement that protesters are not paid. \"Volunteer hosts and participants are stepping forward because they believe in democracy and the rule of law, not because a billionaire is paying them,\" the group wrote in the statement sent after the call. \"The irony is rich coming from a man who spent $277 million to get Donald Trump elected.\"\nA company facing other headwinds\nUsed Tesla prices have fallen by 10.1% in the last 12 months, according to data from iSeeCars.com, while the price of used cars, in general, rose by 1%.\nThat's welcome news for anybody who wants to buy a used Tesla. But that falling value is a blow to current Tesla owners and a red flag for new car shoppers. And because Tesla, as a company, owns a large number of its own vehicles — any Tesla that is leased is technically owned by Tesla — it hurts the company directly, too.\nOn the earnings call, Tesla executives nodded to the falling value of used cars as contributing to reduced profits. There are other headwinds: While Tesla is less affected by tariffs than some rivals, executives said that they would hurt Tesla, too — and Musk said he has attempted, unsuccessfully, to persuade President Trump to support lower tariffs.\nBut overall, Musk said that Tesla is \"not on the ragged edge of death,\" and maintained that the company's long-term profitability relies on robotaxis and autonomous robots — not the more conventional business of selling cars.\nInvestors want to see Musk focus on his businesses\nDan Ives, a stock analyst who has long been a vocal believer in Tesla and Elon Musk, said before this call that it would be a \"code red situation\" if Musk doesn't signal an imminent departure from DOGE. Ives still believes Tesla could have a bright future – if Musk returns his attention to the company.\n\"We view this as a fork in the road time,\" Ives wrote in a widely read note this week — echoing the infamous \"fork in the road\" emails that Musk's employees received when he cut jobs at Twitter, and which federal employees received this spring.\nOn the earnings call Tuesday, Musk did say he would be cutting the time spent on DOGE work — because the bulk of the work was \"mostly done,\" he said, not because of pressure on Tesla. But he made it clear he wasn't leaving DOGE entirely.\n\"I'll have to continue doing it for, I think, for the remainder of the president's term, just to make sure that the waste and fraud we stopped won't come roaring back,\" Musk said. (As NPR and other outlets have reported, Musk's claims of stopping massive amounts of waste and fraud have not been supported by the data DOGE has presented.)\n\"I'll continue to spend a day or two per week on government matters for as long as the president would like me to do so and as long as it is useful,\" Musk said. He did not comment on his status as a \"special government employee\" that is expected to expire around the end of May, given the 130-day cap per year on work people can do for the government under that job category.\nIt was enough for Ives, who told NPR via email after the call that his team views this as \"the beginning of the end of his time in the Trump White House,\" like he had hoped to hear.\nOther investors seem to feel similarly; Tesla share prices rose in after-hours trading.\nTesla's continued EV dominance is not guaranteed\nTesla has had an enormous influence on the growth of electric vehicles in the United States and around the globe. And it has undeniably dominated the EV market in the U.S.\nBut as EV sales surge in China, Chinese manufacturers are unveiling tech breakthroughs, product features and sales numbers that are the envy of other automakers. Chinese EV giant BYD is now neck-and-neck with Tesla for global leadership of EV sales.\nIn the U.S., even as Tesla sales decline, the company still sells far more EVs than any other carmaker. But Tesla's share of the EV market has fallen below 50% and shows every sign of continuing to slide.\nOverall, according to Cox Automotive, new EV sales grew by 7% last year, while Tesla's sales shrank. That's because companies like GM, Toyota and Honda sold a growing number of EVs, enough to make up for shrinking Tesla sales — and then some.\nA more affordable EV or new models in the aging line-up might help Tesla win back market share, but the earnings call was scanty on details on those fronts.\nMusk continues to be confident in Tesla's ability to be the most valuable company in human history. He also dismissed the threat of being out-competed by Chinese companies on artificial intelligence, the technology he's staked Tesla's future on.\nHe said he was confident that Tesla would have the best AI tech in the world.\n\"I'm a little concerned that on the leaderboard, ranked two through 10 will be Chinese companies,\" he said. \"But I'm not worried that rank one will be Tesla.\"","extracted_keywords":["sales","company","ev","time","work","government","year","profits","protests","vehicles"]}

For every famous putt, there has been an equally infamous controversy.\nThis is the story of a unique rivalry, told and shown by those who know it best.\nUSA vs Europe: Golf's raucous rivalry\nBy Jack Bantock, Woojin Lee and Will Lanzoni, CNN\nChapter 1. Stories from golfing legends Colin Montgomerie and Dottie Pepper Colin Montgomerie Dottie Pepper\nColin Montgomerie\nTimes tables and triumphs\nDottie Pepper\nA cause worth dyeing for\nColin Montgomerie\nTimes tables and triumphs\nDottie Pepper\nA cause worth dyeing for\nScroll up or down to explore\nDubbed “the one that started it” by photographer David Cannon, the 1991 Ryder Cup at Kiawah Island in South Carolina opened a new, prickly chapter in the history of the European-American rivalry.\nThe tournament took place shortly after the culmination of the first Gulf War (Operation Desert Storm), with some members of the US team – including Corey Pavin and Steve Pate – wearing camouflage-patterned hats emblazoned with the words “Desert Storm.”\nIt set a patriotic tone that was reflected behind the ropes at the Ocean Course, with heckles getting so nasty and loud that captains at the next tournament worked to bring the noise down, six-time Ryder Cup caddie Fanny Sunesson told CNN in 2021.\nHostilities extended onto the fairways, as accusations of gamesmanship soured proceedings. Team USA’s decision to withdraw an allegedly injured Pate rankled Europe early, before Seve Ballesteros became public enemy number one for the Americans after a series of rules spats with Paul Azinger.\nAzinger blasted the Spaniard as “the king of gamesmanship,” accusing him of purposely coughing when the US players took their shots. Ballesteros responded by accusing Azinger of lying about a rules issue, and would famously later describe the American team as “11 nice guys – and Paul Azinger.”\nA missed putt from Germany’s Bernhard Langer handed a narrow 14.5 - 13.5 victory to the Americans, bringing an end to “the War on the Shore.”\nScroll up or down to explore\nIt says a lot about the events of the 1999 Ryder Cup that it is remembered as much for what happened off the course as it is for the remarkable US comeback that took place on it.\nEurope had taken a 10-6 lead into Sunday at The Country Club in Brookline, Massachusetts, but the US – roared on by a raucous home crowd – rallied in unprecedented fashion, winning the first six matches in a row.\nPositioned in the firing line, photographer David Cannon described the atmosphere towards the Europeans as “vitriolic.” The climate proved too toxic for Colin Montgomerie’s father, who stopped watching his son’s matches due to the intensity of heckling, while Montgomerie’s European teammate Mark James claimed a fan spat at his wife.\nPandemonium ensued when Justin Leonard holed out for a birdie from 40 feet in a crucial match against José María Olazábal, as American players, wives, and caddies flooded onto the green in celebration – even though Olazábal still had a chance to putt and keep Europe in the game.\nThe Spaniard missed, confirming US triumph and reigniting celebrations all over again. The day’s events sparked widespread outrage in European media, with legendary British-American writer Alistair Cooke – in a BBC radio broadcast titled “The Arrival of the Golf Hooligan” – describing the tournament’s final day as “a date that will live in infamy.”\nEuropean vice-captain Sam Torrance would later label it as “the most disgusting day in the history of professional golf.”\n\"The spectators behaved like animals and some of the American players, most notably Tom Lehman, acted like madmen,” Torrance wrote in his 2004 autobiography, “Sam.”\nIt led to a conscious effort to rein in passions at the next event. The 2002 tournament at The Belfry in Warwickshire – delayed by a year after the 9/11 terrorist attacks – was a far calmer affair, with Europe taking victory.\nScroll up or down to explore\nAnnika Sörenstam was left in tears after controversy struck during the 2000 Solheim Cup at Loch Lomond, Scotland.\nEurope had been cruising as the Swede chipped in for a birdie during a four-ball matchup against Pat Hurst and Kelly Robbins, a sublime shot from off the 13th green that drew Sörenstam and playing partner Janice Moodie level – momentarily.\nThe American team challenged that Sörenstam had played out of turn, claiming that it was Robbins’ shot. After much discussion with US captain Pat Bradley, Sörenstam was forced to retake her shot.\nUnable to repeat the feat, a visibly upset Sörenstam watched as Hurst putted to take the hole and, later, the match.\n\"It is just really sad when you have tournaments like this,\" Sörenstam told reporters at the time.\n\"It is sad to see that the ugly part of them (Team USA) came out because both Pat and Kelly are the nicest they have. And it is just sad to see that - that they don't even have sportsmanship.\"\nThe Europeans would have the last laugh, taking a 14.5 to 11.5 victory, but the experience stuck with Sörenstam for years after.\n\"When people ask me what I wanted to be known for, I always said sportsmanship,\" Sörenstam told ESPN in 2013. \"When that happened, that was no sportsmanship at all, and that made me upset.\n\"It wasn't about losing the hole or the match. It was more the principle that somebody could do something like that.\"\nScroll up or down to explore\nAnother rules controversy took center stage at the 2015 Solheim Cup in Germany, but this time it was the Europeans who took on the role of villains.\nTeam USA had been struggling at Golf Club St. Leon-Rot on Sunday morning, but Alison Lee looked set to provide a boost when she putted to within 18 inches of the penultimate hole in a four-ball match against Suzann Pettersen and Charley Hull.\nBelieving her opponents had conceded the putt, Lee picked up her ball to make her way to the final hole, only for Norway’s Pettersen to claim that the shot had not been conceded. Referees upheld the challenge, Lee was hit with a one shot penalty and Europe went on to take the hole and a commanding 10-6 lead into the final round of singles matches.\nA 20-year-old Lee and 19-year-old Hull were left in tears, with US captain Juli Inkster criticizing Team Europe for being “disrespectful.”\n\"I couldn't believe it. I saw Suzann walk away. You don't do that to your peers,” Inkster told reporters.\n\"I expected Carin (Koch, European captain) to do something afterwards but she didn't.\"\nThe incident – later dubbed “gimmegate” – ultimately lit a fire under the US Team, as they roared back in the afternoon to clinch a stunning 14.5 to 13.5 victory.","extracted_keywords":["shot","hole","players","tournament","victory","match","captain","golf","events","putt"]}

Before their births, there were only 44 Western Santa Cruz Galápagos tortoises in the U.S.\n\"Philadelphia Zoo's vision is that those hatchlings will be a part of a thriving population of Galápagos tortoises on our healthy planet 100 years from now,\" Philadelphia Zoo CEO Jo-Elle Mogerman said.\nThe hatchlings are a great way to raise awareness, experts say\nSharon Deem, the director of the Saint Louis Zoo Institute for Conservation Medicine, said that while the birth of the hatchlings may not have a significant direct impact on the total population of the species, the fanfare they are getting could educate the public and spark interest.\n\"These four hatchlings, it's everywhere in the news,\" she said. \"And I think that's amazing to think about.\"\nThe population of this tortoise species began to decline in the early 1800s when sailors and pirates hunting for sperm whales used the tortoises as a food source, said Stephen Blake, Deem's husband and an assistant biology professor at Saint Louis University.\n\"Now, that sounds like a long time ago, but it's really only one lifetime of Galápagos tortoises,\" Blake said. \"Some of the tortoises on Santa Cruz Island today were alive when [Abraham] Lincoln was born. So 1800 sounds like a long time ago, but it's not in the lifetime of a tortoise.\"\nAlthough Western Santa Cruz tortoises are still facing threats such as habitat loss and invasive species, Galápagos National Park and the Charles Darwin Foundation have been vital to their conservation efforts, Blake said.\nHowever, estimating their numbers can be challenging. While adults tortoises are easy to spot, hatchlings often stay hidden to avoid overheating or being eaten by predators, he said.\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature classifies the Western Santa Cruz tortoises as critically endangered, estimating approximately 3,400 tortoises remained as of 2010. Generally, there are about 17,000 Galapagos tortoises left, according to the London Zoo.\nMore about Galapagos tortoises\nGalapagos tortoises are herbivores native to the Galapagos Islands, off the coast of Ecuador. Female tortoises typically lay up to 20 billiard-ball-sized eggs at a time, according to the Philadelphia Zoo.\nThe temperature during incubation determines the hatchlings' sex — eggs incubated at 82.4 degrees Fahrenheit or lower produce female tortoises, while temperatures above 85.1 degrees produce males.\nIt takes the eggs four to eight months to hatch. Males can eventually weigh 500 pounds on average, while females typically weigh 250 pounds.\nIn both zoos and the wild, tortoises can live about 100 to 200 years, the zoo says.","extracted_keywords":["tortoises","hatchlings","eggs","zoo","time","population","species","years","arrival","animal"]}

This is a very bad picture we're looking at.\"\nConnolly shared similar concerns in his letter, highlighting the fact that billionaire businessman and DOGE leader Elon Musk's companies like SpaceX, Tesla and X have cases pending before the NLRB and the Department of Labor.\nBerulis saw around 10 gigabytes of data leave NLRB's network — or the equivalent of a full stack of encyclopedias if someone printed them. Much of that data came from a system that houses information about pending cases, proprietary data from corporate competitors, personal information about union members or employees voting to join a union, and witness testimony. Access to that data is protected by numerous federal laws, including the Privacy Act.\nThe letter asks the inspectors general to answer a number of questions regarding ways DOGE may have potentially violated federal law, including any NLRB networks DOGE staffers had access to and what records of DOGE's work within NLRB systems exist.\nNPR reported that DOGE staffers demanded \"tenant owner level\" access, which offers essentially unrestricted permission to read, copy and alter data, according to the whistleblower disclosure to Congress. The disclosure also noted that controls to prevent insecure or unauthorized mobile devices from logging on to the system without the proper security settings were disabled, an interface was exposed to the public internet, and internal alerting and monitoring systems were found to be manually turned off, among other things.\nSomeone with an IP address in Russia tried to log in with the username and password of a newly created DOGE account just minutes after its creation, the disclosure reads.\nIn over a dozen lawsuits in federal courts around the United States, judges have demanded that DOGE explain why it needs such expansive access to sensitive data on Americans, from Social Security records to private medical records and tax information. But the Trump administration has been unable to give consistent and clear answers, largely dismissing cybersecurity and privacy concerns.","extracted_keywords":["data","access","letter","information","disclosure","records","systems","union","staffers","malfeasance"]}

{"url":"https://www.npr.org/2025/02/13/nx-s1-5293124/special-government-employee-trump-musk-doge","title":"Musk is a special government employee. What is that? : NPR","extracted_core_text":"Trump hired Musk as a 'special government employee.' Here's what that means\nWhen Donald Trump took office for his second term, he moved quickly to bring his political adviser and top campaign donor — tech billionaire Elon Musk — into the government.\nMusk now helms the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, a White House team tasked with cutting federal spending. The unit has terminated a slew of government grants and contracts, according to its X account, and disrupted the work at agencies including the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, where workers have also recently been put on leave or lost their jobs.\nMusk is what's known as a \"special government employee,\" a designation given to people who join the government for a short period of time typically to provide specialized expertise.\nHere's what you need to know about SGEs.\nWhat is a \"special government employee\"?\nIn 1962, Congress created the role of \"special government employee,\" which allows the executive branch, the legislative branch and independent federal agencies to bring on employees for specific roles on a temporary basis.\nTypically, SGEs are hired as experts or consultants or serve as members of federal advisory committees, of which there are roughly 1,000 across the U.S. government.\nSGEs are limited to working for the government for no more than 130 days out of a 365-day period, though they can work multiple years, and they can either be paid or unpaid. NPR has reported that Musk is not being paid for his work with DOGE.\nOne reason government officials take on SGEs is that it's less burdensome than hiring regular federal employees, according to Joanna Friedman, a partner with the Federal Practice Group, a Washington, D.C., law firm specializing in federal employment law.\n\"If you're hired as a federal employee, you have to go through typically the competitive selection process, which means you have to apply for a job and you must be selected as the best-qualified candidate,\" Friedman said. \"This is just an easier way to bring someone on board without as much red tape.\"\nThe Trump administration has also designated other members of Musk's DOGE team as SGEs.\nWhat powers do SGEs have?\nAccording to Kathleen Clark, a professor specializing in government ethics law at Washington University in St. Louis, SGEs are mostly the same as regular government employees and can be given similar powers, including access to sensitive information. Musk and DOGE were granted access to a massive Treasury Department payment system that contains Americans' Social Security numbers and bank account information.\nClark says what's different about Musk's case is that he is exercising power — such as purporting to shut down entire government agencies — that she says is beyond that of anyone in the White House.\n\"The president does not have that power and neither does Elon Musk under our Constitution, which grants Congress the power to control how money is spent by the executive branch,\" Clark said.\nA group of 19 Democratic state attorneys general filed a lawsuit challenging DOGE's authority to shut down agencies and access sensitive information, while another lawsuit alleges a lack of transparency at the office.\nSGEs are bound by certain ethics rules\nBecause many SGEs have jobs in the private sector, there are ethics rules in place to prevent them from using their government work for personal gain.\nDepending on their pay grade, SGEs have to file either a publicly available or confidential financial disclosure form, which typically happens when they start working for the government. (The president, vice president, officials requiring Senate confirmation and certain White House appointees are required to file public financial disclosures.) SGEs may also be required to receive ethics training.\nNPR reported that Musk had received an ethics briefing and would file a confidential financial disclosure report.\nOn top of that, criminal law prevents SGEs (as well as federal workers) from participating in any government matter that could impact their finances. When a conflict arises, SGEs can either recuse themselves from the matter or divest from the relevant financial interest.\nIn an Oval Office appearance on Tuesday, Musk told reporters that DOGE is operating transparently and announcing its actions on its X account. \"Transparency is what builds trust,\" he said. \"And you can see, am I doing something that is benefiting one of my companies or not? It's totally obvious.\"\nTrump, who appeared beside Musk, said he would bar Musk from any government work he believed might create a conflict. \"If we thought that, we would not let him do that segment or look in that area, if we thought there was a lack of transparency or a conflict of interest,\" Trump said. \"We watch that also.\"\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt previously said that Musk would identify any conflicts that arose.\nClark, the Washington University professor, said it is typically government ethics officials — not the employee — who decide whether an employee has a conflict of interest. That's because the determination of a conflict can involve technical information, she said, and also because an employee may not be impartial about their own situation.\n\"You're not supposed to judge your own case,\" Clark said. \"Even if you're an expert, you might want to slant how you apply the law. And we don't trust people, frankly, to apply that.\"\nFriedman, the federal employment attorney, said it would be up to the Justice Department to decide if Musk violated the federal conflict-of-interest law and whether to bring criminal charges.\nPast SGEs have also faced scrutiny\nPrevious administrations have also used SGEs for high-profile roles in government.\nDuring his first administration, Trump hired Dr. Scott Atlas as a science adviser in the summer of 2020 during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. Atlas, who was brought on as a special government employee, was not an infectious disease expert and clashed with other public health officials over his views on the coronavirus. He resigned in November of that year.\nMore recently, Anita Dunn, a founder of the consulting firm SKDK, was forced to divest a multimillion-dollar investment portfolio when she became a senior adviser to President Biden in 2022. She had previously worked as an SGE for the Biden administration.\nAnd during the Obama administration, GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa raised questions about the \"special government employee\" designation given to then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's aide Huma Abedin, who had also worked for the Clinton Foundation and the consulting firm Teneo.","extracted_keywords":["government","employee","sges","law","ethics","conflict","work","agencies","officials","administration"]}

But that kicks up a lot of smoke, or oxidative stress, that can harm cells.\nHorses, it turns out, have evolved an unusual way of regulating this tradeoff that allows them to produce more energy without incurring more cellular damage, researchers report in the journal Science. Those genetic changes may, in part, explain how horses became such powerful athletes, able to outrun and outlast virtually all other animals.\n\"Horses can make this fire burn even hotter and make the damage even less than it would be in a species like a human,\" said Castiglione.\nThe changes occurred in a key gene pathway called NRF2/KEAP1. The pathway senses the buildup of oxidative stress and then kickstarts antioxidant production, which can clean it up, said Castiglione. \"This is essentially the energy production and fire department, all wrapped in one.\"\nCastiglione and his colleagues were scanning the genomes of nearly 200 mammalian species looking for unusual variants in this pathway. Horses stuck out with a single, highly unusual mutation.\n\"It's a type of mutation called a nonsense mutation,\" he said. \"That's because it breaks a gene, it inactivates it from doing what the cell needs it to do.\" It basically put a stop sign, called a stop codon, toward the beginning of the KEAP1 gene. Stop codons generally signal where a gene ends, so having one at the start would \"break\" the gene.\nThis mutation kills mice, probably because it allows too much \"smoke\" to build up in cells. So Castiglione was stumped. \"We thought, wow, how are horses dealing with this?\"\nThrough a variety of genomic and molecular techniques, the researchers found an answer.\n\"Horses have evolved a very intricate strategy for working around this stop codon,\" said Elia Duh, a study co-author and molecular biologist at Johns Hopkins University. Essentially, a suite of mutations allows them to ignore the stop sign, making the gene work, but in a slightly different way that ends up benefiting the horses.\nThe researchers found that these mutations, which arose in the ancestors of all modern horses, allow their muscle cells to produce up to five times more energy than mouse cells, while simultaneously ramping up their damage-control system by 200%.\n\"This provides them with the biochemical means to run fast and over long distances,\" said Duh. This ultimately helps them become aerobic powerhouses.\n\"I really love this paper,\" said Samantha Brooks, a horse genetics researcher at the University of Florida. The mutation, she said, \"should have caused a catastrophic loss of function for this protein. But instead, the ancestors of these species somehow managed to really turn that lemon into lemonade.\"\nThe way they made lemonade — ignoring a stop codon — has only previously been reported in viruses, the researchers say.\nThis adaptation could have implications for human health. Many inherited diseases, like cystic fibrosis and muscular dystrophy, stem from stop codons arising in important genes. If researchers can better understand how horses manage to ignore such stop codons, said Duh, perhaps they could develop gene therapies that do just that in humans, too.","extracted_keywords":["horses","gene","stop","energy","cells","researchers","mutation","species","fire","production"]}

Researchers know that honeybees are under pressure from pesticide use, habitat loss and mite infestations, but they can't yet explain why 2025 has been such a lethal year.\nBut the honeybee is not the only bee that can work in the fields. Today, most farmers use honeybees to pollinate their crops, even though they are, in fact, terrible at pollinating, says David Hunter, CEO of Crown Bees in Woodinville, Wash., who sells a different type of bee.\nInstead of spreading pollen from flower to flower, the honeybee carries most of the pollen back to the hive.\nBut behold the humble mason bee! Also called the blue orchard bee, it inelegantly \"belly flops\" onto a flower, Hunter says. It flings pollen everywhere. Covered in pollen, the hairy mason bee then goes to the next flower and bellyflops again, which gives it a higher pollination success rate.\nThis is well-known in the bee world and backed up by the U.S. Department of Agriculture research. (In fact, the USDA named the mason bee a \"pollinator-of-the-month.\")\nBut farmers still rely on the honeybee, in part because these bees live in large hives that can be picked up and moved to different fields. Hunter says there is also an \"only one bee mentality, and this is helping create the pollination mess we find ourselves in today.\"\nMason bees are among the 4,000 types of bees native to the U.S. The honeybee isn't one of them — they were brought to the U.S. from Europe in the 1600s.\nMason bees don't live in hives and they don't make honey. There is no queen bee and there are no worker bees. \"All females are queens,\" says Hunter.\nFemale mason bees lay their eggs in cavities or tubes, and then seal the entrance with mud to protect them from predators. Because they build chambers inside the tubes, they were given the name mason bees.\n\"It's an interesting life cycle,\" says Hunter. \"Through the summer, they become big larvae, spin a cocoon, and metamorphose to an adult. And in the fall, it's an adult bee in a cocoon that just hibernates through the winter.\"\nHunter, who is on the board of directors of the Planet Bee Foundation, is an evangelist for the mason and the leafcutter bee, which also nests in cavities. He is trying to spread the word about native bees because, like the honeybee, they are under pressure.\nHunter started his company, Crown Bees, which builds and sells bee hotels, to get more native species into backyards as well as onto commercial farms. Today, he sells and ships bees and bee hotels all over the country.\nBeth Cummings, a retired college professor in Gig Harbor, Wash., first tried mason bees after her fruit trees burst into bloom in the spring, but they actually produced only a few pieces of fruit.\n\"We were obviously missing some pollinators,\" says Cummings, who now orders bees in their cocoon stage to arrive in the mail each spring, which then hatch as temperatures warm. \"You give them a place to live, a way to make mud since they don't hive, and you never really see them. It's a pretty hands-off sort of deal.\"\nMason bees are a shy bee and rarely sting. That means the garden isn't dangerous for Cummings' elderly father, who is allergic to bees.\nAnd when summer is over? After a bit of work scraping out the cocoons, they can be stored in the refrigerator. But Cummings prefers to mail the slender tubes back to Crown Bees, which will care for them over the winter. Next spring, her bees will be mailed back to her, and she'll slide them back into place in her bee hotel.\nThe results, says Cummings, have been \"very fruitful.\"","extracted_keywords":["bees","bee","honeybee","pollen","honeybees","losses","today","flower","mason","tubes"]}

The venture is the brainchild of TMRW Sports, a company co-founded by Woods and McIlroy.\nThe opening game of the new league sees the trio of Rickie Fowler, Matt Fitzpatrick and Xander Schauffele of the New York Golf Club take on The Bay Golf Club’s Shane Lowry, Wyndham Clark and Ludvig Åberg.\nAhead of Tuesday’s opening match, McIlroy described it as “golf, but it’s reimagined, sort of trying to take golf into the 21st century.”\n“We have teams, obviously, there’s a lot of technology involved, trying to bring it into the digital era,” he told ESPN. “A lot of things that we’ve taken from other sports like a shot-clock, a timeout, things that you don’t see in regular golf. (We’re) trying to appeal to that bigger sports audience out there.”\nMcIlroy also added that he and Woods have been extremely hands on during the organizational period of their new tournament.\n“Tiger and I have been a part of this from day one and whenever you see the concepts and the renderings you think, ‘Yeah, that looks really cool,’” McIlroy told ESPN. “But until you actually stand in here (the SoFi Center) and you see what they’ve been able to do, I think the scale of it is the thing for me that blows my mind.\n“Every time I step in here, I’m just blown away by the size of the screen, the fact that we’re able to put something that looks like golf on a stage like this. It’s really cool and we’re obviously really excited about it within the game of golf. I think a lot of other people outside of the game are going to see this and hopefully get excited about it as well.”\nWhat is the format?\nTeeing off Tuesday night, six teams comprising of 24 mic’d up stars of the PGA Tour will compete across a 15-match regular season at the 1,500-capacity arena in Palm Beach Gardens before the postseason begins, culminating in a best-of-three Finals Series showdown for the SoFi Cup on March 24.\nGolfers on each four-player team will hit tee and approach shots into a 64-by-53-foot simulator before moving to the GreenZone; a green that can be uniquely rotated and sloped on each hole thanks to a turntable and actuators under its surface.\n“The playing surfaces are very realistic,” McIlroy explained. “Whenever you hit it out of the rough, you have to think about whether you’re going to get a flyer (or) whether it’s going to come out soft. A lot of things that you would have to think about on a real golf course.”\nA single match is contested over two sessions, with each match seeing three players from each team going head-to-head over 15 specially designed holes and two different formats – nine holes of triples and six holes of singles.\nTriples sees the three players on a team rotate who hits shots as well as taking turns to tee off. The singles format has players matched directly with an opponent, with each player on the team of three playing two singles holes.\nEach hole is worth one point, a tied hole is worth no points and the team with the most points at the end of the match wins. If the scores are level after 15 holes, a closest to the pin competition will decide the winner.\nAn added element of intrigue is the “Hammer,” which allows teams to double the value of a hole. If it is accepted by the opposition, a hole is worth two points. The opposition team could choose to play the “Hammer” on the same hole making it worth three points but could also use it later in the match.\nIf a team declines their opponents’ use of the “Hammer,” they concede the hole and the points on offer.\nThe makeup of the teams’ various ownership groups makes for a who’s who of sporting heavyweights, with tennis sisters Serena and Venus Williams, NBA stars Giannis Antetokounmpo and Steph Curry, as well as Liverpool soccer club owners Fenway Sports Group (FSG), among the backers.\nPlenty of major winners are littered throughout the players involved in TGL, with both Woods and McIlroy also taking part.\nTGL teams\nAtlanta Drive GC\nJustin Thomas (USA), Patrick Cantlay (USA), Billy Horschel (USA), Lucas Glover (USA)\nBoston Common Golf\nRory McIlroy (Northern Ireland), Hideki Matsuyama (Japan), Keegan Bradley (USA), Adam Scott (Australia)\nJupiter Links Golf Club\nTiger Woods (USA), Max Homa (USA), Tom Kim (South Korea), Kevin Kisner (USA)\nLos Angeles Golf Club\nCollin Morikawa (USA), Sahith Theegala (USA), Justin Rose (England), Tommy Fleetwood (England)\nNew York Golf Club\nMatt Fitzpatrick (England), Rickie Fowler (USA), Xander Schauffele (USA), Cameron Young (USA)\nThe Bay Golf Club\nLudvig Åberg (Sweden), Wyndham Clark (USA), Min Woo Lee (Australia), Shane Lowry (Ireland)\nTGL schedule\nRegular season\nJanuary 7: New York GC vs. The Bay GC\nJanuary 14: Los Angeles GC vs. Jupiter Links GC\nJanuary 21: New York GC vs. Atlanta Drive GC\nJanuary 27: Jupiter Links GC vs. Boston Common GC\nFebruary 4: Boston Common GC vs. Los Angeles GC\nFebruary 17: Atlanta Drive GC vs. Los Angeles GC, Atlanta Drive GC vs. The Bay GC, The Bay GC vs. Boston Common GC\nFebruary 18: Jupiter Links GC vs. New York GC\nFebruary 24: Los Angeles GC vs. New York GC, Boston Common GC vs. Atlanta Drive GC\nFebruary 25: The Bay GC vs. Jupiter Links GC\nMarch 3: The Bay GC vs. Los Angeles GC, New York GC vs.\nBoston Common GC\nMarch 4: Jupiter Links GC vs. Atlanta Drive GC\nPostseason\nSemifinals: March 17, March 18\nFinals Series: March 24, March 25","extracted_keywords":["golf","team","hole","match","teams","holes","points","lot","players","game"]}

She tracked it all. Losing her has been a very hard and difficult process to go through.”\nWoods announced the death of his mother, Kultida Woods, earlier in February.\nPreviously, the 15-time major champion had been planning to compete at the Genesis Invitational in what would have been his first PGA Tour event in seven months but withdrew a few days before, saying he was “not ready” following the loss of his mother.\nDespite not taking to the course in a competitive manner, Woods was present at Torrey Pines for the Genesis Invitational which saw each player wear a red pin in their hats, adorned with the Thai symbol for love as way of respecting Kultida.\nSpeaking to CBS, Woods says he hopes that he’ll be able to make playing on the PGA Tour a more regular occurrence in 2025.\n“My goal was to play more and I haven’t played,” the 49-year-old said. “Got to work on that. This process was unexpected. I’ll get back after it and look forward to playing some of the bigger events.”\nWoods was also on hand to present the winner’s trophy to Ludvig Åberg after the Swede rallied late to win the tournament by a single shot.\nÅberg hit four birdies in the final six holes to claim his second PGA Tour title by finishing a shot clear of Maverick McNealy in second.\nThe future of golf\nAlthough Woods has been away from playing, he’s been heavily involved in the administration of golf.\nThe 82-time PGA Tour champion has been a key voice in the negotiations between the key stakeholders in the sport as they try to come to an agreement after a controversial split following the emergence of the Saudi-back LIV Golf tour in 2022.\nWoods has been at the table for negotiations between the PGA Tour and LIV and revealed on Sunday that there was a meeting involving US President Donald Trump, PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan and 2013 Masters champion Adam Scott as they attempt to bring an end to the divide in golf.\nAnd Woods admitted that he believes that golf is in a “very positive place right now.”\n“I think that things are going to heal quickly. We’re going to get this game going in the right direction,” he said. “It’s been heading in the wrong direction for a number of years and the fans want all of us to play together, all the top players playing together and we’re going to make that happen.”","extracted_keywords":["golf","mother","process","event","champion","death","tournament","support","players","time"]}

DOGE is trying to access all of it\nElon Musk's team within the Trump administration has sought sweeping access to databases that store personal information on millions and millions of Americans.\nThe data collected and maintained by the government isn't just your name, home address, and Social Security number.\nSome federal agencies store information that many people don't share even with their closest friends and family: Medical diagnoses and treatment. Notes from therapy sessions. Whether a person has filed for bankruptcy. Detailed income information.\nAnd now, Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, has accessed heavily safeguarded databases that store such personal information, raising deep alarm among federal workers and privacy advocates.\nMusk says he is targeting waste and fraud. The executive order establishing DOGE says its purpose is \"modernizing Federal technology and software to maximize governmental efficiency and productivity\" and it instructs agency heads to ensure DOGE \"has full and prompt access to all unclassified agency records, software systems, and IT systems.\"\nBut Erie Meyer — who resigned last month from her post as chief technologist at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau after the change in administration — doesn't trust DOGE.\n\"Part of what is unnerving and is scary both to companies whose data is involved and also Americans whose most sensitive financial information is at risk, is that we don't know what they're doing,\" she says.\nNormally, according to Meyer, federal employees handling sensitive data must pass extensive background checks. But it's not clear what sort of vetting or background checks Musk's staff has undergone.\nMusk says his staffers need to have the same security clearances as other employees. \"Anyone from DOGE has to go through the same vetting process that those federal employees went through,\" Musk said recently on The Joe Rogan Experience.\nSome agency heads have pushed back on the notion that DOGE is accessing too much data, saying that DOGE has \"read-only\" access, and cannot make changes in their systems.\nAt least a dozen lawsuits have been filed over DOGE's access to data. Unions and groups like the Center for Taxpayer Rights are filing lawsuits — both to stop DOGE from accessing any more data, and to discover what kind of information the team has already collected.\nDeep privacy concerns\nThe risks are real, according to the half-dozen technology experts who spoke with NPR for this story. Americans' personal data could be sold, lost, or leaked. Or it could be used to enrich a few. But above all, they warn: Americans' essential privacy is at stake.\nThere are several laws, including the Privacy Act of 1974, that govern how the government collects and stores personal data. Strict rules limit when government agencies can share that data with each other.\nThose limits are by design. \"Everyone thinks the government already has this data\" in a connected way, says one former federal worker who did not want to be named to preserve future job prospects. \"But they really don't, because it's firewalled.\"\nSome current and former government workers fear that Musk's plan is to bring huge amounts of government data together, to create deeply personal profiles on individual Americans.\nOne of them is Jonathan Kamens, who was overseeing cybersecurity for VA.gov until he was terminated last month alongside some 40 of his colleagues at the U.S. Digital Service, a little known government unit that Trump turned into DOGE. He points to authoritarian regimes that create dossiers used to control individuals.\n\"That's what I want people to be scared of,\" says Kamens. \"That this data that the government has on them, which in some cases can be used to damage them, will be used to damage them.\"\nDOGE did not reply to questions from NPR about the personal information it is accessing and how it plans to use that data.\nHere's an overview of a few federal agencies that hold data on large swaths of Americans – and where things stand with the DOGE team's access.\nInternal Revenue Service (IRS)\nWhat the agency has: Names, addresses, Social Security numbers for everyone who has paid federal taxes. Financial information including income and net worth. Bank account information for direct deposits. Any itemizations, from medical expenses to charitable donations. Whether someone has filed for bankruptcy or been a victim of identity theft. And much can be inferred from the data, including marital status, dependents, and familial relationships.\nWhere things stand: The White House and Treasury Department have agreed to prohibit DOGE from accessing personal taxpayer data, The Washington Post reported, and instead will have read-only access to anonymized tax data. NPR has not independently confirmed this reporting, and the IRS did not reply to NPR's request for information on what access DOGE has.\nBut with new leadership coming to the IRS, there's concern that DOGE's access could be expanded in the future, according to a current employee who did not wish to be identified for fear of retaliation.\nWhy it matters: Tax records reveal many aspects of someone's life. Also, if someone had the ability to edit IRS data, they could write their own tax bill down to zero, and \"max out those of your enemies,\" said the employee.\nSocial Security Administration (SSA)\nWhat the agency has: Records of individuals' lifetime wages and earnings. Social security numbers of workers and their beneficiaries, and the type and amount of benefits they receive. Information on those applying for Supplemental Security Income, including citizenship status, income, and payment amount. Disability and health status data on everyone who has applied for Disability benefits.\nWhere things stand: A coalition of unions and retirees have filed a lawsuit aiming to halt DOGE's access to SSA data. Democratic senators including Tammy Baldwin and Elizabeth Warren have sent letters demanding to know exactly what access DOGE has.\nLeland Dudek, SSA's acting commissioner, said in an earlier statement that DOGE personnel have read-only access and cannot make changes to systems, benefit payments, or information.\nWhy it matters: Tiffany Flick, the agency's acting chief of staff until she retired last month, expressed her concerns about DOGE access in a declaration included in the lawsuit filed by the unions. Flick believes that DOGE staffers are accessing SSA information from inside the Office of Personnel Management. That could mean that SSA's data protections don't work and that data can be accessed by other staff who have not been vetted or trained by SSA:\n\"Others could take pictures of the data, transfer it to other locations, and even feed it into AI programs,\" she said. \"In such a chaotic environment, the risk of data leaking into the wrong hands is significant.\"\nCenter for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)\nWhat the agency has: Basic personal information as well as health information. For everyone with Medicare (the program generally for people 65 or older), CMS has their Social Security number and documentation of their eligibility, says a source who previously worked with CMS and Social Security systems who requested anonymity to preserve future job prospects.\nWhere things stand: According to a statement from a CMS spokesperson, two veteran employees of CMS are \"leading the collaboration with DOGE.\" The DOGE staffers have been given \"read-only access\" and \"none of the information they have access to contains the personal health information of Medicare or Medicaid enrollees,\" the spokesperson said.\nWhy it matters: \"They have the largest amount of data in one single place about the largest group of users of health care,\" says the person familiar with CMS systems.\nA data breach could mean the sharing of Americans' sensitive health data – and a company could use health data and financial data together to charge people more for health services.\nVeterans Affairs (VA)\nWhat the agency has: VA's health care arm is the largest integrated health care network in the country, so the agency has vast stores of veterans' health data. That includes records of substance abuse and addiction, mental health issues, even notes from therapy sessions. That's in addition to basic personal information like addresses and phone numbers. The VA also stores veterans' military records.\nWhere things stand: A DOGE staffer has been present at VA, and it's not clear what data he has access to, according to a current agency employee with knowledge of the situation, who requested anonymity to avoid retaliation. Senate Democrats have also requested information about what access has been granted.\nIn a statement, a VA spokesperson says \"DOGE does not have and has not had access to Veterans' or VA beneficiaries' data.\"\nVA Secretary Doug Collins has sought to calm concerns about DOGE's access. \"There's also this rumor out there that DOGE is … going to take personal information,\" Collins said in a recent video. \"We got DOGE representatives here that are doing what they're supposed to be doing,\" like looking at contracts for efficiencies.\nWhy it matters: Jonathan Kamens, who was detailed to the VA as an employee of the U.S. Digital Service, offers a hypothetical example: A veteran who speaks out against the Trump administration, whose records show a history of PTSD and opioid addiction following battlefield injuries.\nSomeone with access to all that information could use it to discredit the veteran in the public eye, Kamens posits.\nAnd there's another big risk: \"The data that the federal government holds on people is kind of the identity theft motherlode,\" says Kamens. \"So if you can just steal the government data, you can pretend to be anyone. It's kind of terrifying.\"\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)\nWhat the agency has: Personal data including names, addresses, Social Security numbers, and financial transactions. CFPB also has troves of data it collects as it pursues litigation. If the bureau has investigated a company for collecting too much information on people, it has that, too.\nWhere things stand: The Trump administration has required bureau staff to give DOGE sweeping, \"God-tier access\" to the bureau's data, says Erie Meyer, the former chief technologist of CFPB. The bureau did not respond to NPR's questions on what access DOGE staffers have to CFPB data and systems.\nAmid litigation, the government has agreed for now to not delete or remove data held by CFPB, following a declaration by Meyer that Trump appointees planned to delete databases holding CFPB data.\nWhy it matters: The bureau also has the consumer complaints that people submit to the bureau about companies. \"So that database could have not just people's information, but the worst financial thing that has ever happened to them and how a company responded,\" says Meyer.\nThe bureau also has large amounts of data on companies, including market research, financial records and business plans. One concern, voiced by Senate Democrats among others, is that Musk could use the data that the bureau has collected on payment apps Zelle and Cash App to get an inside edge for the digital payment platform he's planning.\nNPR Correspondent Hansi Lo Wang contributed to this story.","extracted_keywords":["data","information","access","government","agency","health","people","bureau","systems","records"]}

Since then, \"the MRI guy\" has repeatedly been at odds with the nation's leading health officials regarding his views on how to combat the spread of the virus, including members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force.\nThroughout his tenure, he has insisted all of the guidance he has offered was based on scientific research.\n\"I worked hard with a singular focus—to save lives and help Americans through this pandemic,\" Atlas wrote in a resignation letter posted to Twitter.\nHe added that he \"always relied on the latest science and evidence, without any political consideration or influence.\"\n\"As time went on, like all scientists and health policy scholars, I learned new information and synthesized the latest data from around the world, all in an effort to provide you with the best information to serve the greater public good,\" Atlas wrote.\nFox News reported that Atlas' role was set to expire at the end of the week.\nPresident Trump was attracted to Atlas' views, which put the economy first, but public health experts were appalled by his lack of scientific rigor.\nAmong the theories that most worried experts is Atlas' belief that allowing the coronavirus to spread would eventually result in \"herd immunity,\" describing it as a \"basic principle\" of biology and immunology.\nAs NPR reported:\n\"In April on the conservative Steve Deace Show, Atlas spoke in favor of allowing the virus to pass through the younger segments of the population, while trying to protect older Americans.\n\" 'We can allow a lot of people to get infected,' he said. 'Those who are not at risk to die or have a serious hospital-requiring illness, we should be fine with letting them get infected, generating immunity on their own, and the more immunity in the community, the better we can eradicate the threat of the virus.' \"\nAtlas' field of expertise is in magnetic resonance imaging. He wrote a book on the subject and co-authored numerous scientific studies on the economics of medical imaging technology.

Scientists have unveiled a promising therapy - a combination of three drugs that target a genetic mutation that causes cystic fibrosis, which affects the lungs and can cause respiratory failure. This new therapy could benefit 90% of patients with the disease.\nDr. Francis Collins is director of the National Institutes of Health, and he's one of the scientists who discovered the gene defect behind cystic fibrosis 30 years ago.\nDr. Collins, welcome.\nFRANCIS COLLINS: Thank you. Great to be with you.\nKELLY: So I saw that you wrote in a blog post you are overjoyed. Just tell me how it feels to be able to announce this.\nCOLLINS: Oh, wow, Mary Louise, it has been 30 years that we've been hoping and dreaming for a day like this, where you could look at data and just absolutely - your jaw drops because it is so impressive and so good. Now we are at the point with this triple therapy where 90% of people with cystic fibrosis are going to have substantial and amazing benefit from the drug therapy that looks as if it will convert what has been otherwise a very threatening and potentially fatal disease into a chronic illness that's going to require treatment but which should allow people to live much more normal lives. And waiting 30 years and having this happen, yeah, I'm overjoyed.\nKELLY: Yeah. And when you say convert this to more of a chronic disease that can be managed, that sounds similar to, I don't know, more like diabetes or something. Is that the way you're thinking about it?\nCOLLINS: I think this is more in a place where you could say this is becoming a manageable chronic disease like diabetes or like arthritis where you know you're still going to need that treatment. These drugs will need to be taken, but they have this remarkable ability to correct the protein that's not doing its job, which is the problem in cystic fibrosis that we discovered 30 years ago.\nKELLY: Right. And I understand that part of what's so critical here is that this drug therapy targets the genetic root of the disease, not just treating the symptoms. Is that right?\nCOLLINS: That's absolutely right. The drug therapy is designed to specifically encourage this protein that is misspelled and is folded improperly, to get its folding correct and to get itself to the right location in the cell, and then gives it a little kick to get it to activate its functions. And I think a lot of people thought that was going to be almost impossible to compensate for. But here we are.\nKELLY: There's a line from the Washington Post story about this that I was just reading that I'm going to read in full because I found it so moving. Patients who were unsure about whether they should bother attending college because they'd always known they would die young are now being told they should think about planning for retirement.\nCOLLINS: Yes.\nKELLY: it's amazing.\nCOLLINS: It is amazing. You might have thought people would have after a while just said, oh, heck, it's not going to work. Nobody ever said that. For 30 years this journey has been pursued by thousands of scientists from all sorts of different perspectives. And all of us gathered right now in Nashville, Tenn. are having a pretty big celebration.\nKELLY: As we mentioned, this new drug therapy could benefit 90% of people with cystic fibrosis. What about the other 10?\nCOLLINS: We must not abandon the 10% of people for whom these drugs will not provide benefit. And everybody who is working on cystic fibrosis is 100% behind that sentiment. And the good news is there is now a lot of momentum to get to that place as well and ultimately to develop not just a drug therapy, but a cure.\nKELLY: One more practical question, which is - this therapy is super expensive. A year's treatment is going to cost more than $300,000. Will patients have access to it now that it exists?\nCOLLINS: The cost is very high. I know the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, which has been such an amazing supporter of patient needs, is going to be working very hard to be sure that no patient who needs access to this treatment is going to be deprived because of financial reasons. And I think the company will also try to work on that. The price tag is a little breathtaking, but something will need to be done to be sure that nobody misses the chance for a new life with this opportunity in front of them.\nKELLY: I can hear the joy in your voice as you're discussing this. And...\nCOLLINS: (Laughter) I can't help it.\nKELLY: Yeah. I am told that after you first identified the cystic fibrosis gene, you wrote a song.\nCOLLINS: I did. We sang it this morning, actually.\nKELLY: Would you share a tiny bit with us?\nCOLLINS: Sure. So the song is called \"Dare To Dream.\" And I wrote it at a time where, yes, we understood what the DNA misspelling was, but we were a long way from knowing how that could help people therapeutically. And the chorus is dare to dream, all our brothers and sisters breathing free.\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\nCOLLINS: (Singing) All our brothers and sisters breathing free. Unafraid, our hope's unswayed (ph) until the story of CF is history. Do that one more time.\nAnd we sang that this morning here in Nashville at the major cystic fibrosis meeting. And I had a borrowed guitar and stood up in front of 5,000 people and put the chorus up on the screen. And they stood up, and they sang their hearts out. And it was hard to keep going and not just get choked up. It was a moment.\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\nCOLLINS: (Singing) Let's turn the story of CF into history.\nKELLY: What a moment. That is NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins talking about this new therapy, a combination of three drugs that could help up to 90% of people currently living with cystic fibrosis.\nDr. Collins, thank you very much.\nCOLLINS: You're welcome.\nCopyright © 2019 NPR.

Instead, the agency restricted access to patients ages four and five until more evidence is available that the therapy is safe and effective.\nThe decision elicited mixed reactions. Parents of children suffering from the genetic disorder, advocates and some doctors and researchers welcomed the limited approval. But some were disappointed the treatment isn't being made more widely available right away.\n\"Today is a very important day,\" Debra Miller, who leads CureDuchenne, an advocacy group, told NPR in an interview. \"But every single day these boys are losing muscle cells. And so when you have a son with Duchenne and you see them getting weaker right before your eyes, you know we have to get therapies to patients sooner rather than later.\"\nFDA's accelerated approval came with limits\nOthers, however praised the agency's restraint, though some argued even the limited approval was premature.\n\"This is a really critical decision for the FDA to get right,\" Dr. Caleb Alexander of Johns Hopkins University told NPR in an interview. Alexander voted against approval during a May meeting of an FDA advisory committee that narrowly recommended the agency grant approval.\n\"This has implications not only for those who may receive this product. But it also sends an important signal regarding what the FDA will require for future products to treat this and similarly devastating diseases,\" Alexander said.\nThe company that developed the treatment, Sarepta Therapeutics of Cambridge, Mass., said the therapy would be available as soon as possible. The treatment, called Elevidys, will cost $3.2 million for each patient, the company announced shortly after the approval.\nSarepta asked the FDA to approve the gene therapy under a program that allows the agency to provide access to treatments before direct evidence is available that they are effective.\nBut this accelerated approval process is controversial because some companies fail to follow through on their promises to confirm their treatments work. A drug approved this way to prevent premature birth was recently withdrawn after being found useless.\nSarepta's muscular dystrophy treatment is the first gene therapy approved under the program.\nThe disease, which almost exclusively affects boys, destroys muscles. Most boys end up in wheelchairs before they become teenagers. Eventually, their hearts and lungs give out. Most people with the disease die in their 30s or 40s.\nThe gene therapy works by infusing trillions of harmless viruses in single treatment that has been genetically modified to ferry a gene to patients' muscles.\nEvidence for the gene therapy is indirect\nThe gene produces a miniature version of a protein called dystrophin, that boys with muscular dystrophy are missing or don't have enough of. The hope is this \"micro-dystrophin\" will at least help slow the progression of the disease.\nBut there's an intense debate about this. Sarepta based its request on how much micro-dystrophin it produces in patients' muscles — without direct evidence that's actually helping alleviate symptoms and prevent disease progression.\nDuring the May advisory meeting, parents and doctors showed dramatic videos of children who could barely stand and walk, running, biking and and easily climbing stairs after the treatment.\nBut Alexander and other experts say it remains unclear the treatment is responsible and is safe.\n\"This product is not without risks. And I think the evidence is murky,\" Alexander says. \"The evidence really doesn't meet the bar required to reach market.\"\nAnd children who receive the treatment may then be ineligible to get other treatments in the pipeline that may be more effective.\n\"That's a really non-trivial concern,\" Alexander said.\nBut others said there is sufficient evidence to warrant broader approval, including preliminary evidence the treatment is improving boys' muscles, as well as animal data and clear evidence the therapy boosts micro-dystrophin in muscles.\n\"What's the old expression: 'Don't let perfect get in the way of good?' \" said Jeffrey Chamberlain, who directs the Muscular Dystrophy Research Center at the University of Washington.\nThat said, Chamberlain was glad the FDA at least approved the treatment for younger children pending further data.\n\"You'd like to see approval for as broad a range of patients as possible. But we'll take what we can get at this point,\" Chamberlain said.\nMichael Kelly, the chief scientific officer for CureDuchenne, says he hopes this will lead to other, even more effective gene therapies for the disease.\n\"This is a critical and really important step in treatment and this is going to lead the way and blaze a trail for the next round of better therapeutics,\" Kelly told NPR in an interview.","extracted_keywords":["treatment","approval","gene","therapy","evidence","dystrophy","patients","disease","agency","children"]}

And that’s just what worries some scientists who have been studying a particular species of ant.\nThis ant, nicknamed the ManhattAnt, first turned up in the city in 2011. Back then, no one knew where it came from, and for years it was mostly ignored.\nBut this ant has flourished in the Big Apple, so much so that it’s now vying with a species called the pavement ant for being the most common ant in the city, according to a report in the science journal Biological Invasions.\nWhat’s more, ManhattAnts have started to spread beyond their namesake island, expanding their territory at a rate of about a mile a year.\n“We predict that they could expand as far north as Maine and as far south as Atlanta, Georgia,” says Clint Penick of Auburn University. “This is an ant that could become quite common throughout the East Coast.”\nHe and some other scientists are now trying to figure out why it has been so successful, in order to better predict whether it’s likely to threaten native insect species or damage trees and other plants.\nAfter all, tiny ants can sometimes cause big problems.\nAn influential list of the 100 worst invasive species worldwide includes a number of ants, points out Mariano Rodriguez-Cabal at the University of Vermont.\nHe says invasive species are a leading cause of extinction and biodiversity loss.\n“We’re talking about a big, big issue here,” he says. “It’s not like just a crazy ant running around Manhattan.”\nGetting to work in New York\nThis fairly large ant looks like no other species in the New York area, with a dark brown body and a reddish-orange midsection.\nBefore this ant first appeared in Manhattan, Rob Dunn, an ecologist at North Carolina State University, had been working with students to survey the various ant species of the city. These prior studies helped make it clear that this one was truly a new arrival.\nThe New York Post hailed it as “a new breed of ruffi-ant” living in “the Broadway medians at 63rd and 76th streets.”\nDunn and his team didn’t know what to make of the critter.\n“There was this ant species that wasn’t supposed to be there,” says Dunn. “It was possible it was a species that was new to science, from somewhere else.”\nThe question of this ant’s true identity “sort of sat quietly in the corner, in our peripheral vision, while we did all kinds of other things in the city,” says Dunn.\nMeanwhile, this ant was busy making itself at home: “Even when we weren’t doing that much work on it, it was doing lots of work on New York, Dunn says.\nEventually, Penick organized some genetic and body-shape studies that definitively identified it as Lasius emarginatus, a species that’s native to Europe.\nThat effort involved consulting with a European ant expert who could hardly believe that this ant was living it up in the city that never sleeps, Penick recalls.\n“He was like, ‘Are you sure? Lasius emarginatus?’ He was like, ‘They’re not even really dominant in any European area,’” says Penick. “They’re not known as urban pests. So it was quite surprising that this species was the one that was taking over Manhattan.”\nAn ant in Times Square\nThis ant was, indeed, starting to dominate the island — although the vast majority of the more than 1.5 million human residents didn’t notice.\nIts importance started to dawn on Penick as he continued to visit New York to study ants over the years, and found that this species “formed a larger and larger portion of the samples I was collecting.”\nOne day he traveled over to New Jersey, to stay at a friend’s place. When he got off the subway, he was surprised to see ManhattAnts underfoot.\n“At this point, they had crossed the Hudson, and made it into New Jersey and were just living on the sidewalk,” he says.\nThat seemed weird, he says, as normally only the pavement ant hangs out on sidewalks. Other ants generally like to dwell in places like soil and leaf litter – including this species, which in its native Europe can be found making its home in forests.\nBut being surrounded by concrete and human activity does not seem to faze the ManhattAnt.\n“We found a colony of them in a little flower planter box in the middle of Times Square, which was, I thought, pretty shocking,” says Samantha Kennett, a PhD student at Clemson University.\nAnd while ants typically stick rather close to the ground, this species likes to climb way up, startling New Yorkers who aren’t used to seeing ants in high-rises.\n“I was at someone’s rooftop the other day, on the sixteenth floor, and they marched by,” says Ellen van Wilgenburg, an insect researcher at Fordham University.\n“They’re everywhere. They’re literally everywhere,” she says. “They’re on my stoop in front of my building. When I walk to work, or to the Trader Joe’s, I pass several colonies.”\nSpeed walking and street fighting\nAnt species that get introduced into a brand new environment often form supercolonies, van Wilgenburg says. That means their nests all contain ants that are closely related and genetically similar, so the different nests don’t fight with each other.\nThat’s not the case with ManhattAnts.\nTests in the lab show that ants taken from different New York nests will treat each other like strangers and duke it out. Even neighboring nests that are physically close to each other, like in adjacent flower pots, can treat each other as dire enemies.\n“They are very aggressive towards other ants, and you will see them carrying other ants’ bodies,” says Clancy McCann, a Fordham University student who’s been studying this ant with van Wilgenburg.\nIzzie Kaplan, another Fordham student, says ManhattAnts — like many New Yorkers — are also speed walkers.\n“They’re very fast, and that’s another reason why we’re super interested in them,” says Kaplan. Their speed may give them an advantage in the city as they compete with other species for resources.\nIn general, these ants eschew human food, although Kennett says her research shows that they will resort to whatever’s available in “really urban sidewalk habitats.”\nTheir main sustenance is honeydew, a kind of sugary poop excreted by aphids and scale insects.\nThe ants seem to be going up into street trees to forage for honeydew, says Kennett, and it may be that they’ve found a gig that’s not really being pursued by other ants in this city.\nBut ants that like honeydew will protect and care for the plant pests that produce it, increasing the numbers of pests and consequently making life harder for the plants. Invasive Argentine ants in California tend aphids in this way, for example, and have proven to be a real headache for citrus orchards there.\nIt’s “entirely possible” that, in the long term, ManhattAnts could have a negative effect on city trees, says Kennett, who says these ants seem to be foraging constantly, even at night. “I wish we could just see what they were doing all the time.”\nA stealthy invasion\nThe fact that ManhattAnts haven’t been obvious trouble-makers so far isn’t necessarily reassuring.\n“We know that invasions that appeared minor for decades can suddenly boom and then cause major problems,” notes Benoit Guénard, an insect biodiversity researcher at the University of Hong Kong.\nThe Asian needle ant, for example, has been in the United States since the 1930’s but wasn’t recognized as a threat until about twenty years ago. This ant not only invades buildings, but also has moved into forests, decimating native ants that normally help disperse seeds.\nAnts can have ripple effects through ecosystems that lead to unexpected consequences. One study published earlier this year found that invasive ants in Kenya caused a series of changes that ultimately resulted in lions eating fewer zebras.\nScientists feel fortunate to know where and when the ManhattAnt showed up, and to have reasonably good information about how it’s spreading — thanks in part to sightings logged by everyday people into the Project ManhattAnt section of the website iNaturalist.\nIt seems that so far, the ant has likely been expanding its range during its annual mating season, when ants briefly sprout wings and fly short distances. But at some point it might hitch a ride in a car or a truck, and travel farther. And as it moves out into the rest of the northeast and beyond, scientists just aren’t sure what the future holds.\n“Here is an ant living in close proximity to millions and millions of New Yorkers, any of whom could make a new discovery about that ant,” says Dunn. “We know so little about it.”","extracted_keywords":["ants","ant","species","city","scientists","nests","years","insect","trees","work"]}

Washington State University researchers expect that this year the losses will be between 60 and 75%. Fewer honeybees means fewer crops are pollinated, and that, of course, threatens food production. It's apparently well known in the bee world that honeybees are not particularly good at pollinating. Other bees are more accomplished. David Hunter owns Crown Bees in Woodinville, Washington, and is an evangelist for the native mason bee. Mr. Hunter, thanks for being with us.\nDAVID HUNTER: I'm glad to be here.\nSIMON: First, let me ask, why are so many honeybees dying off?\nHUNTER: There's a lot of stressors that are impacting not only the honeybee, but just worldwide insects. And you could say that the top three would be climate change, and then the lack of habitat where these insects used to live and get their foods. And then probably also at the top of that list would be the chemical onslaughts, whether that's in pesticides or herbicides or various -cides. I think the coalescion (ph) of all of this mess is hurting the entire honeybee industry.\nSIMON: With regard to their losses and contribution to agriculture that benefits us all, you don't, I gather, believe the honeybee is actually well-equipped for pollination.\nHUNTER: It's a well-used pollinator, but most of the pollen gets stuck to their hind legs. They're very fastidious. Ninety-five percent of the pollen heads back to the hive. The 5% - they have so many numbers in the field. That 5%, that does help pollinate. But when you look at the solitary bee, every female is a queen, and if she's out there buzzing, they're just unsophisticated, belly-flopping into a flower. Pollen is kind of held all over their bodies, next flower, belly-flopping into that flower and most the pollen stays in the flower and in the field.\nSIMON: The U.S. Department of Agriculture has named the mason bee pollinator of the month.\nHUNTER: I've been working alongside them for, oh, about 15 years, and there's been a lot of research that's shown when you add the mason bees to cherries, you're doubling your yield. The gardeners across the country, when they put these bees in their yards, you're just getting more berries and cherries and apples and beans and melons in the summer.\nSIMON: I gather your company ships bees all over the country. How does that work?\nHUNTER: So we raise our bees in backyards across North America. We help these people raise these little solitary bees in little bee hotels. In the fall, people open their little nesting holes up, and they've got cocoons in their hands. They keep some, share some with friends, and send the rest out here in Washington state. So we then clean them up, put them in bins, and when people want to try these bees out in their yards the next spring, we're putting them in FedEx two-day air envelopes and just mailing cocoons.\nSIMON: Wow.\nHUNTER: So I just think the importance that people need to realize is everyone can do something about it. In their backyard, can they think through, what is an oasis from a bee's perspective? I have pollen and nectar available from early spring, deep into late summer. I'm trying not to spray chemicals if I can. And then, I've got a bee hotel. That's my industry. You're able to stand in front of this hotel without any fear of getting stung and just watch nature pollinate your yard.\nSIMON: David Hunter owns Crown Bees.

Here's why farmers would go bust without bees\nHoneybee deaths rose last year. Here's why farmers would go bust without bees\nIf you like to eat blueberries, apples, almonds and other fruits that require pollination, you can thank a honeybee. Farmers could not grow these crops without the essential service bees provide.\n\"We depend on honeybees for our existence,\" says Hail Bennett of Bennett Orchards in Frankford, Del., which has just opened its fields to u-pick visitors for peak season.\nEach spring, just as his blueberry bushes are flowering, Bennett rents loads of bees from a commercial beekeeper. For three weeks, the bees buzz around, moving millions of grains of pollen within and between flowers to pollinate the plants.\n\"It's pretty amazing how much work the bees have to do,\" Bennett says. There are millions of flowers on his 6 acres of blueberries, and \"each flower has to be visited six to eight times by a honeybee in order to be fully pollinated,\" Bennett explains as he splits open a plump berry to inspect its seeds.\n\"You want to have at least 15 seeds in the fruit, Bennett says, looking approvingly as he counts them. \"That tells you the flower was adequately pollinated in the spring,\" he says.\nBennett recalls hearing stories about the collapse of honeybee colonies when he was in high school. Across the country bees were disappearing from their hives. Now, a new survey of beekeepers finds bees are still struggling.\n\"Over the entire year, we estimate that beekeepers lost 48.2 % of their colonies,\" says Dan Aurell, a researcher at Auburn University's bee lab, which collaborates with the nonprofit Bee Informed Partnership to perform the survey.\nThe report covers the period between April 2022 and April 2023 and included 3,006 beekeepers from across the U.S. This year's count marks the second-highest estimated loss rate since 2010 to 2011, when the survey started recording annual losses.\n\"This is absolutely a concern,\" Aurell says. \"This year's loss rates do not amount to a massive spike in colony deaths, but rather a continuation of worrisome loss rates.\"\n\"It's bad,\" says former USDA research scientist Jeff Pettis, in regard to the survey findings. \"It shows beekeepers are still being affected by a number of challenges,\" he says. Beekeepers are finding they need to work harder to maintain their colonies, says Pettis, who is the president of Apimondia, an international federation of beekeepers associations.\n\"A major concern for bees is the Varroa mite,\" Pettis says. It's a small parasite that feeds on bees and makes it difficult for them to stay healthy. \"It shortens their lifespan,\" Pettis says. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Varroa is an invasive species that originated in Asia, and Pettis says beekeepers can use organic acids and other synthetic products to protect their bees.\nPettis keeps bees on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, where he's had some success using formic acid to treat against Varroa mites. \"The organic acids are effective, but they do take time and money,\" Pettis says.\nOther challenges bees face are beyond the control of any one beekeeper, Pettis says. They include the use of pesticides, a loss of nutrition sources for honeybees due to urbanization, or land use practices leading to fewer and less diverse food sources, such as wild flowers.\nThere's also a concern that can seem hidden in plain sight — climate change. \"When you layer on the big, broad issues of climate change, bees are really struggling,\" Pettis says.\nBlueberry farmer Hail Bennett says he aims to be a good steward of the land. He invited a hobbyist beekeeper, Steven Reese, to set up on his farm, which could help some of their visitors learn how crucial bees are to his operation, and to agriculture overall.\nReese is retired from the Air Force and now works as a civilian for the Army. He says beekeeping is relaxing for him, almost a form of meditation. He says it is work to manage his bees, but he's been able to maintain his numbers, and grow his colonies, by dividing hives when some of the bees die. \"If I left them feral, so to speak, and allowed them to survive on their own, it would be a much higher loss rate,\" so the effort is worth it, he says.\nReese says bees never cease to amaze him, with their hive instincts and sophisticated ways of organizing themselves. \"They communicate in phenomenal ways,\" he says.\nFor farmer Hail Bennett, the bee is paramount. Without bees there are no blueberries.\n\"It's important for people to understand and remember where their food comes from,\" Bennett says.","extracted_keywords":["bees","beekeepers","year","loss","pettis","colonies","survey","deaths","farmers","blueberries"]}

In the Southwest, people are taking notice even before spring break and summer vacations. KUER's David Condos reports from Zion National Park in Utah.\nDAVID CONDOS, BYLINE: This is typically the slow season at Zion National Park, but on a recent Saturday morning, there's a long line of cars waiting to get in. Just two of the four entrance stations at the park's main gate are open. Now, it's unclear if that's due to the National Park Service jobs President Trump cut. The White House isn't confirming details about it, but Democratic lawmakers and employee groups say it's about a thousand jobs nationwide. Zion National Park declined to comment. People around here are worried, though.\nBARBARA BRUNO: Today is just a day in February, and look at the line. So it's - we're more concerned about the - not the big holidays, but the everyday kind of traffic and congestion that we might experience.\nCONDOS: Barbara Bruno is the mayor of Springdale, the town closest to Zion's main entrance. She says around a dozen Zion rangers lost their jobs, and the long line of cars to get into the park is backed up into town, where locals are protesting.\nUNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting) Take a stand, protect the land.\nCONDOS: More than 100 people chant and carry signs against a backdrop of towering red-rock peaks. They're upset about the firings, and worry about what that means for the future of public lands. Local business owner Jaechon Anderson organized the protest.\nJAECHON ANDERSON: I truly believe that all Americans love the parks, and so we're here today fighting for them, fighting for their future. Mother Nature doesn't have her own voice, so she needs us right now.\nCONDOS: Visitor numbers start rising dramatically in March here. Last year, nearly 5 million people came to Zion. On busy days, Mayor Bruno says the line of cars can block Springdale residents from their homes and make it hard for emergency vehicles to get through. She says firing so many workers also makes it hard for staff who remain on the job.\nBRUNO: They're beloved members of our community, and I feel for them. I think that they're all sort of worried about what the future holds, and the park was already understaffed and underfunded.\n(SOUNDBITE OF FOOTSTEPS)\nCONDOS: Inside Zion, Helena Parks is taking a photo. She's visiting from California and says she's a federal worker, too. Overall, she agrees with the job cuts.\nHELENA PARKS: The new presidency comes in, they're trying to do something good. Not everybody sees it that way, but it's an action.\nCONDOS: While losing park jobs is unfortunate, she says, it may be a necessary part of reining in the federal budget. But Bill Wade, the head of the Association of National Park Rangers, expects tourists to notice the reduced staffing, from shorter hours at visitor centers to dirtier bathrooms.\nBILL WADE: When you use a broadsword instead of a scalpel to go through a thousand positions and indiscriminately terminate them, I just don't see that as being the efficient way to do things.\nCONDOS: A memo obtained by NPR says the Park Service has permission to hire a larger number of seasonal staff than in previous years, but Wade says...\nWADE: I think it's unlikely that all of those seasonals are going to be hired and onboard before the heavy-use season actually gets underway.\nCONDOS: In the meantime, unions have filed lawsuits over how the Trump administration eliminated jobs, including at the Park Service. Now, many of the fired workers were probationary, meaning they were new to the agency or had recently started new roles there. One of them was Macie Monahan, a biologist at Utah's Bryce Canyon National Park.\nMACIE MONAHAN: When I got removed from my position illegally, I was 10 days away from being off my probationary period. I was hoping and praying that it wouldn't happen.\nCONDOS: But then she got the mass termination email that went out on Valentine's Day. It told her she was fired for poor performance, even though she says her reviews were positive.\nMONAHAN: I wasn't slacking off and wasting taxpayer money. I was out in the field for 10 hours a day. I was working in unstable weather conditions or getting down and dirty with some prairie dogs at times. You know, I'm out in the field doing hard work.\nCONDOS: So getting that email hurt. She worries it'll end up hurting the parks, too. Monahan says Bryce Canyon was already short-staffed relative to its millions of visitors, so she and the other rangers often worked above and beyond to keep it running.\nMONAHAN: My passions are still there, and, you know, I hope and pray we can kind of get back to what we were doing before, eventually.\nCONDOS: Until then, she's not sure what will happen to the projects she was working on.

The rising number of cases has not led to a corresponding rise in the number of deaths — yet.\nBut Collins tells NPR's Steve Inskeep on Morning Edition that an increase in the number of fatalities will soon follow, as it has previously when cases and hospitalizations went up.\n\"All of this, I'm afraid, happens because we have not succeeded in this country in introducing really effective public health measures, those simple things that we all could be doing,\" he says. \"Wear your mask, keep that 6-foot distance and don't congregate indoors whatever you do, and wash your hands. It's so simple. And yet people are tired of it. And yet the virus is not tired of us.\"\nCollins talked with NPR about the status of vaccine development, the White House coronavirus task force and President Trump's comments about Dr. Anthony Fauci, the leading infectious disease expert on the task force. Here are excerpts of the interview:\nYou see the end of the year as within the realm of possibility [for approving a vaccine], but not anything we should plan on.\nThis is a really tough scientific challenge. We are doing everything possible to try to develop and test the vaccines in the most rigorous way. But you never know. Anybody who's worked on vaccines before will tell you there are things that happen.\nAnd by the way, two of these trials are currently on hold because of a concern about a possible safety issue. People should be reassured by that, that that means we're really looking at the safety issues with great scrutiny. But that does say that those two trials are of somewhat uncertain status. And we'll have to see what happens in the coming days about reactivating those if they are judged to be safe after all.\nSo many uncertainties here, but I am guardedly optimistic, as I think are most of the experts who are watching over this — including Dr. Fauci, who I talk to every day about this, because he works for me — that we will have, by the end of the year, one or more of these that will pass this very high standard of safety and efficacy. ...\nI would think it's very unlikely, given the timetables and the standards that have to be followed, that you will hear about an emergency use authorization before late November at the earliest.\nYou're part of the coronavirus task force that has been advising the White House. ... There's more prominence for a new member, Dr. Scott Atlas, who's not an infectious disease expert. ... Is the president still listening to experts who know what they're talking about?\nThe task force continues to meet regularly at least once a week and to wrestle with a whole lot of the issues, especially now that we see the worsening of the pandemic in the middle of the country, which is really quite a serious concern. And the vice president presides over all of those task force meetings and is incredibly engaged with all of these questions and deliberations and decisions that have to be made. We have not met with the president in quite some time. ...\nI think the president primarily is getting his information from the vice president, from Dr. Atlas, obviously it's a bit of a chaotic time with the election. So, yeah, there's not a direct connection between the task force members and the president as there was a few months ago. But this seems to be a different time with different priorities.\nThe president ... was talking about the campaign with people in his campaign yesterday, and he said people are tired of hearing Fauci and \"these idiots.\" ... Do you regard Dr. Fauci in those terms?\nTony Fauci is probably the most highly respected infectious disease expert in the world. He's also a terrific communicator. And I think the public has actually been greatly benefited by hearing his unvarnished, unflinching descriptions of what's happening with this worst pandemic in more than 100 years. I have great confidence in him.\nHow clear do you think public health messaging has been in this crisis and how clear has it continued to be? Dr. Fauci has one particular message. The president has a different set of messages.\nWell, I think the public does sometimes get confused about exactly what's going on here. And it doesn't help that social media plays its role, spreading around a whole lot of conspiracy theories that sometimes are absolutely outrageous but seem to capture people's attention.\nI would just urge people listening to our conversation right now: trust the public health experts. They don't really have an ax to grind. Trust CDC, trust Fauci, trust the folks at the FDA who are trying to do their jobs. They don't have any particular reason to spin the information. They're going to try to do their best to share with you what we know and what we don't know. So, yeah, consider the source. If you're trying to get public health information, it's probably good to listen to a public health expert.\nNina Kravinsky and Steve Mullis produced the audio interview.","extracted_keywords":["president","people","task","force","cases","health","end","expert","number","disease"]}

Scientists have unveiled a promising therapy - a combination of three drugs that target a genetic mutation that causes cystic fibrosis, which affects the lungs and can cause respiratory failure. This new therapy could benefit 90% of patients with the disease.\nDr. Francis Collins is director of the National Institutes of Health, and he's one of the scientists who discovered the gene defect behind cystic fibrosis 30 years ago.\nDr. Collins, welcome.\nFRANCIS COLLINS: Thank you. Great to be with you.\nKELLY: So I saw that you wrote in a blog post you are overjoyed. Just tell me how it feels to be able to announce this.\nCOLLINS: Oh, wow, Mary Louise, it has been 30 years that we've been hoping and dreaming for a day like this, where you could look at data and just absolutely - your jaw drops because it is so impressive and so good. Now we are at the point with this triple therapy where 90% of people with cystic fibrosis are going to have substantial and amazing benefit from the drug therapy that looks as if it will convert what has been otherwise a very threatening and potentially fatal disease into a chronic illness that's going to require treatment but which should allow people to live much more normal lives. And waiting 30 years and having this happen, yeah, I'm overjoyed.\nKELLY: Yeah. And when you say convert this to more of a chronic disease that can be managed, that sounds similar to, I don't know, more like diabetes or something. Is that the way you're thinking about it?\nCOLLINS: I think this is more in a place where you could say this is becoming a manageable chronic disease like diabetes or like arthritis where you know you're still going to need that treatment. These drugs will need to be taken, but they have this remarkable ability to correct the protein that's not doing its job, which is the problem in cystic fibrosis that we discovered 30 years ago.\nKELLY: Right. And I understand that part of what's so critical here is that this drug therapy targets the genetic root of the disease, not just treating the symptoms. Is that right?\nCOLLINS: That's absolutely right. The drug therapy is designed to specifically encourage this protein that is misspelled and is folded improperly, to get its folding correct and to get itself to the right location in the cell, and then gives it a little kick to get it to activate its functions. And I think a lot of people thought that was going to be almost impossible to compensate for. But here we are.\nKELLY: There's a line from the Washington Post story about this that I was just reading that I'm going to read in full because I found it so moving. Patients who were unsure about whether they should bother attending college because they'd always known they would die young are now being told they should think about planning for retirement.\nCOLLINS: Yes.\nKELLY: it's amazing.\nCOLLINS: It is amazing. You might have thought people would have after a while just said, oh, heck, it's not going to work. Nobody ever said that. For 30 years this journey has been pursued by thousands of scientists from all sorts of different perspectives. And all of us gathered right now in Nashville, Tenn. are having a pretty big celebration.\nKELLY: As we mentioned, this new drug therapy could benefit 90% of people with cystic fibrosis. What about the other 10?\nCOLLINS: We must not abandon the 10% of people for whom these drugs will not provide benefit. And everybody who is working on cystic fibrosis is 100% behind that sentiment. And the good news is there is now a lot of momentum to get to that place as well and ultimately to develop not just a drug therapy, but a cure.\nKELLY: One more practical question, which is - this therapy is super expensive. A year's treatment is going to cost more than $300,000. Will patients have access to it now that it exists?\nCOLLINS: The cost is very high. I know the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, which has been such an amazing supporter of patient needs, is going to be working very hard to be sure that no patient who needs access to this treatment is going to be deprived because of financial reasons. And I think the company will also try to work on that. The price tag is a little breathtaking, but something will need to be done to be sure that nobody misses the chance for a new life with this opportunity in front of them.\nKELLY: I can hear the joy in your voice as you're discussing this. And...\nCOLLINS: (Laughter) I can't help it.\nKELLY: Yeah. I am told that after you first identified the cystic fibrosis gene, you wrote a song.\nCOLLINS: I did. We sang it this morning, actually.\nKELLY: Would you share a tiny bit with us?\nCOLLINS: Sure. So the song is called \"Dare To Dream.\" And I wrote it at a time where, yes, we understood what the DNA misspelling was, but we were a long way from knowing how that could help people therapeutically. And the chorus is dare to dream, all our brothers and sisters breathing free.\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\nCOLLINS: (Singing) All our brothers and sisters breathing free. Unafraid, our hope's unswayed (ph) until the story of CF is history. Do that one more time.\nAnd we sang that this morning here in Nashville at the major cystic fibrosis meeting. And I had a borrowed guitar and stood up in front of 5,000 people and put the chorus up on the screen. And they stood up, and they sang their hearts out. And it was hard to keep going and not just get choked up. It was a moment.\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\nCOLLINS: (Singing) Let's turn the story of CF into history.\nKELLY: What a moment. That is NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins talking about this new therapy, a combination of three drugs that could help up to 90% of people currently living with cystic fibrosis.\nDr. Collins, thank you very much.\nCOLLINS: You're welcome.\nCopyright © 2019 NPR.

But they didn't think it was anything serious.\n\"He would fall a lot. Not like a lot a lot. But he had trouble climbing playground equipment. He fell down the stairs at his pre school a couple of times,\" says his mother, Susan Finazzo, 40, who lives in Miami.\nChase's younger brother, Dylan, was more agile. But he started walking a little late.\n\"We're not thinking anything of it. He's just got some weak ankles. He's got some little tiny little orthotics for toddlers,\" she says. \"He's sees an orthopedic surgeon. We've got PT. We're all over it.\"\nSo Susan and her husband Chris Finazzo were stunned when doctors told them both boys had Duchenne muscular dystrophy. While rare, the disease is the most common inherited neuromuscular disorder among children. It affects an estimated 10,000 to 12,000 children in the U.S.\nThe disease, which almost exclusively affects boys, destroys muscles. Most boys end up in wheelchairs before they become teenagers. Eventually, their hearts and lungs give out. Most people with the disease die in their 30s or 40s. It's incurable.\n\"It's absolutely devastating,\" says Susan Finazzo. \"You end up going through a mourning process. You're mourning the loss of the life that your child should have had.\"\nFinazzo couldn't help but wonder of her children: \"Are they going to be able to go to college? Are they going to live that long? Are they going to be able to fall in love? Have children of their own? You thought you were going to have soccer practices. And now you're wondering: How much time am I going to have with them?\"\nFinazzo and her husband started giving their sons steroids to help them even though the drugs can cause side effects and can't slow down the disease. They also started looking for better options.\nFinally, they volunteered Chase, who's now 8, and Dylan, who's now 5, for a study testing an experimental gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy.\nThe gene therapy works by infusing trillions of harmless viruses that has been genetically modified to ferry a gene to patients' muscles. The gene produces a miniature version of a protein called dystrophin, that boys with muscular dystrophy are missing or don't have enough of. The hope is this \"micro-dystrophin\" will at least help slow the progression of the disease.\n\"I hope that this can extend their lives a little bit. At the end of the day as a Duchenne parent, you don't even care about the wheelchair anymore. You don't care about the not walking,\" Finazzo says. \"I just want them to be alive longer. I want them to be alive long enough to enjoy what life is. So if this moves the needle in their life expectancy — even if it does it for a day — it's worth it.\"\nBut there's an intense debate about this. Sarepta Therapeutics, the Cambridge, Mass., company that developed the treatment, wants the Food and Drug Administration to approve the gene therapy largely based on how much micro-dystrophin it produces in patients' muscles — without direct evidence that's actually helping alleviate symptoms and prevent disease progression.\nThe FDA has convened a committee of independent advisors to consider whether to recommend the approval on May 12.\nThe approval would come through a process known as accelerated approvals. That lets the FDA approve promising treatments quickly before strong evidence is available that the therapy helps, as long as companies promise to then conduct follow-up studies to prove it works.\n\"We're dealing with a very serious rare disease. A deadly disease. Every day matters to these patients,\" says Douglas Ingram, Sarepta's CEO. \"This could be the most important therapy so far developed for children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. We have, at least from our perspective, the perfect opportunity to use the accelerated approval pathway.\"\nBut this accelerated approval process is controversial because some companies fail to follow-through on their promises to confirm their treatments work. A drug approved this way to prevent premature birth was recently withdrawn after being found useless.\nSarepta's gene therapy for muscular dystrophy would be the first gene therapy approved through the accelerated approval process. And the request has reportedly triggered intense debate within the FDA.\nSarepta has yet to complete the required follow-up studies for three other treatments focused on dystrophin for muscular dystrophy previously approved through the accelerated approval process, according to Dr. Reshma Ramachandran, who studies drug approvals at the Yale School of Medicine.\nThat leaves open the question of whether micro-dystrophin levels are an accurate way to assess treatments for the the disease, she says.\n\"We're still left uncertain whether or not these very expensive treatments actually yield a meaningful clinical benefit, or if we're just simply still guessing,\" Ramachandran says.\n\"This question's been looming since 2016: Is dystrophin an appropriate proxy measure for clinical benefit for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. That's still a looming question. And the fact that it's, you know, seven years later and we still don't have an answer is a bit appalling,\" she says.\nIf it turns out not to help, Ramachandran worries the approval could discourage the development of other treatments that could work and preclude patients from being eligible for those therapies.\nAnd then there's the issue of cost. Though the company hasn't released expected costs yet, other recently approved gene therapies have cost as much as $3 million to treat each patient.\nThe costs, which may not always be covered by insurance, could drain money families could otherwise use for much-needed treatment, such as physical therapy and in-home care-givers, she says.\n\"That's real harm,\" she says.\nDr. Glen Nuckolls at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke said he couldn't comment directly on Sarepta's request. But he too expressed reservations about relying on a surrogate marker.\n\"There's certainly data to suggest that you start making dystrophin it's going to result in regeneration of the tissue and increased strength. But I think the relationship of what exact level is needed, we'd probably like to have some more data on that,\" Nuckolls says.\nBut Ingram, Sarepta's CEO, says waiting for more data would come with a cost.\n\"During that period of waiting, some six to 800 kids will die. Some 600 to 800 kids will be consigned to a power wheelchair for the rest of their lives. Six hundred to 800 kids will be consigned to permanent ventilation,\" Ingram says. \"All of these kids ... will be irreparably damaged in ways we won't be able to reverse.\"\nThe company says it has preliminary data indicating the gene therapy is helping patients, and already has a big study to confirm those finding well underway.\nThe company's request is being supported by groups like the Muscular Dystrophy Association.\n\"Surrogate endpoints like dystrophin measurements allow more access,\" says Dr. Barry Byrne from the University of Florida, the association's chief medical advisor. \"An analogy would be a drug that lowers cholesterol is expected to have an improvement in cardiovascular mortality. So it's a similar analysis.\"\n\"We believe that it is slowing the disease and hopefully stabilizing these patients,\" says Debra Miller, who heads CureDuchenne, a patient advocacy group that helped fund Sarepta. \"We have high hopes that at least for many years we'll be able to arrest the downward progression of this disease through gene therapy.\"\nFor her part, Susan Finazzo knows it's possible the drug won't help her sons, but she's hopeful.\n\"I'm just so excited that we even got the opportunity to take part in this [study]. Because the majority of the kids can't. So this is this is an amazing opportunity,\" she says.\nEach year at her sons' birthdays, she's reminded of how little time they have to help them.\n\"Birthdays are especially hard because they're bitter sweet,\" Finazzo says. You're so happy but then you're also knowing that that's one less year with them. That's just a reminder of the clock's that ticking.\"\nThe digital version of this story was edited by Carmel Wroth; broadcast edited by Scott Hensley.","extracted_keywords":["gene","therapy","disease","dystrophy","approval","patients","treatments","children","process","kids"]}

Regina Barber here. And this time, I've got two of our favorites for our regular roundup of science news. Juana Summers - hey, Juana.\nJUANA SUMMERS, BYLINE: Hello. Thank you for letting me hang out again.\nBARBER: And science correspondent Pien Huang - hey, Pien.\nPIEN HUANG, BYLINE: Hey, Regina. Hey, Juana.\nSUMMERS: Hi.\nBARBER: As always, we're going to share three science stories in the news that have caught our attention recently.\nHUANG: No. 1, how a bunch of tiny, invasive ants have changed how elephants act and what lions eat.\nBARBER: What a sample of ancient chewing gum tells us about dental care and diets in the Stone Age.\nHUANG: And then billions of cicadas appearing this spring.\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\nHUANG: All that on this episode of SHORT WAVE, the science podcast from NPR.\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\nBARBER: All right, Juana, you're the guest. Which topic do you want to start with?\nSUMMERS: Oof (ph), hard to pick - I'm kind of into all of these. But I don't know, let's start with the ants.\nHUANG: OK, so this story starts in the Savannah at a nature preserve in central Kenya. And Juana, if we went back 20 years, we would see grasslands that are covered with acacia trees.\nBARBER: And these trees provide food and shelter for native ants. And in turn, the ants defended the trees against animals that would eat the trees like elephants. Like, when elephants would grab tree leaves, the native ants would swarm up inside their trunks and bite them.\nSUMMERS: This does not sound fun.\nBARBER: No. No, not at all. And for a long time, the trees and the ants had this, like, mutualistic relationship.\nHUANG: And then about, like, 20 years ago, this new invasive ant showed up. It's called a big-headed ant. And it starts taking over the territory, killing the native ants and leaving these trees undefended.\nSUMMERS: OK, I think I know how the story goes. Let me guess here - the elephants are running rampant on these trees?\nBARBER: Yeah, they are. They're not just eating the leaves. The elephants are pulling down the branches. They're knocking the trees over. And Douglas Kamaru, he's an ecologist at the University of Wyoming. And he says that these elephants have torn down so many acacia trees that they've transformed the landscape.\nDOUGLAS KAMARU: Now we are seeing, like, these areas opening up from the dense we're talking about in terms of those acacias to more open landscape, like a grassland or something like that.\nBARBER: And he says, elephants have cleared 70- to 80% of the trees in the park, and this is all over the last 20 years.\nSUMMERS: OK. We mentioned that the story is also about lions, so help us fit that part of the animal kingdom in here.\nHUANG: Yeah, right. So for the lions at this park, their favorite food is zebra. And the lions usually catch the zebras by hiding behind trees, stalking them, and then boom, they pounce. And this open landscape, it means that they're losing the element of surprise. I mean, the zebras can now see them coming from across the field, and they get plenty of time to escape. So Kamaru and his team actually found that the lions were almost three times better at hunting zebra in that tree-covered area, like what the whole park used to be, than on the open grassland that's there now.\nBARBER: And this took years of fieldwork and observations and experiments to figure all this out. It's all detailed in the journal Science this week, and one outside researcher who wasn't involved in the work told us that these connections in ecology can be really messy. But she was impressed with how well the study documented these links.\nSUMMERS: Got a question for you - what does this all mean for the lions? I mean, if they can't catch the zebras, are they starving?\nHUANG: Well, it turns out that there's actually some evidence that they're switching their diets. So as the proportion of zebra in their diet goes down, the amount of buffalo has gone up. So that means that so far, the lion population seems OK. Like, their numbers are stable. There are still places in the park with tree cover where they're having decent luck catching zebras. But these tiny, invasive ants are still taking over the park at a rate of about 160 feet a year, and it's not clear if they can be stopped.\nSUMMERS: All right, next up, I think you all have brought a story about something that does not sound particularly tasty to me - Stone Age chewing gum?\nBARBER: Yes, that's right. But Juana and Pien, I'm really curious - what's your opinion on gum? Like, do you love it? Do you hate it?\nHUANG: I'm going to go with love it. I love Bubble Tape.\nSUMMERS: I absolutely cannot stand it.\nBARBER: Oh, no. I love gum. I have, like, packs all over my house, in my car. But most relevant to the study - my teenager loves it, too.\nSUMMERS: OK, I live with teenagers, too. That sounds like something that could get very messy in a kid's room. But please explain. What do teenage gum preferences have to do with the Stone Age?\nBARBER: So it's because this study published in the journal Scientific Reports looks at what teenagers ate in Scandinavia about 10,000 years ago. And this is all by analyzing the ancient gum they chewed.\nSUMMERS: OK, what flavor of gum are we talking about here 10,000 years ago?\nBARBER: (Laughter).\nHUANG: Well, I mean, gum was a different thing back then. You know, basically it was tar made from the bark of birch trees. And people in the Stone Age used to chew a wad of this and then maybe, like, stick some tools together with it. And as you chew gum in general, it collects stuff from your mouth, you know, genetic material, bacteria, little bits of food stuck in your teeth. And so this Stone Age wad of gum is something like a time capsule of what they were eating.\nSUMMERS: OK, I am going to need to hear about the menu in Stone Age Scandinavia.\nBARBER: Yeah, I was very interested. So I asked an archaeogeneticist (ph) at Sweden's Stockholm University about this - Anders Gotherstrom. Here's what he said people were snacking on in the middle Stone Age or Mesolithic period.\nANDERS GOTHERSTROM: So what's a proper Stone Age diet? At least now we know that if you go home and put hazelnuts, trout and deer in your frying pan, then you would have a Mesolithic diet from Scandinavia.\nHUANG: And this gum also has, like, the imprints of teeth, which gives you the size of the teeth, which is also how they knew that the gum chewers were teenagers. And Gotherstrom and his team could tell from the mix of bacteria in the gum that one of the teens actually had very bad gum disease.\nGOTHERSTROM: We know that she was about to lose her teeth.\nSUMMERS: Ouch. Although, I guess it's not super surprising that someone who lived almost 10,000 years ago needed some dental work.\nBARBER: Yeah. Gotherstrom said that she probably was in a lot of pain while chewing that gum. And while that's very sad for her, there's this little silver lining for researchers in the fact that we can learn so much detail of the daily life of a Stone Age person from a small piece of gum.\nSUMMERS: Interesting. All right, let's move on now to cicadas. And I should just point out that this topic is such a big deal in my household. My husband absolutely loves cicadas, but I'm going to let you guys explain.\nBARBER: Yeah. So scientists have determined that this spring, two adjacent groups of cicadas will emerge at the same time all across the Midwest and the Atlantic states, meaning billions of cicadas, at least. Our colleague Clare Marie Schneider wrote about this, and one entomologist she talked to described it as a spectacular, macabre Mardi Gras.\nSUMMERS: OK, so this sounds like my kind of party, but I should note that not everyone would probably love this. So tell us - are these the kind of cicadas that come up every summer or is this something more special?\nHUANG: OK, this is more special. I mean, there are annual cicadas, but these are more rare. So these two regional groups, or broods, of cicadas only emerge every 13 or 17 years. And the really exciting thing here is that the last time that these two specific broods - again, one on a 13-year-cycle, the other on a 17-year-cycle - the last time that they came up at the same time was in 1803.\nSUMMERS: That is a long time ago. OK, can one of y'all remind me how their life cycle works? - because 13 or 17 years, that is a long time to stay underground.\nHUANG: It's a super long time, yeah. So periodical cicadas spend all of that time underground in this immature nymph form where they're sucking on the roots of shrubs and trees and feeding. And when that time comes, they emerge. They molt. The males have this, like, glorious cacophony of calls and songs, which can actually be louder than a jet engine. And then these cicadas mate. The females lay their eggs in trees.\nBARBER: And the cycle starts all over again, like, when the eggs drop from the tree and return to the ground for another 13 or 17 years.\nSUMMERS: So tell me, when exactly does this cicada Mardi Gras kick off?\nBARBER: So one brood will start appearing in late April, mostly in the South, and the other will appear in mid-May around Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana and Michigan.\nSUMMERS: All right, guys, I am setting myself a reminder to book a plane ticket back to the Midwest for that.\n(LAUGHTER)\nBARBER: Awesome.

This species nests in rotting wood and will fight rivals to defend its home, so Frank wanted to see how these ants would react when confronted with the kind of injuries that come with battle.\nHis team quickly observed that these ants would cut off wounded legs, much like miniature Civil War-era surgeons. “And this really piqued my interest,” he says.\nAn injured ant will present its leg to a nestmate, who will lick the wound and then move up the leg to bite at the shoulder joint for many minutes at a time, until the leg is severed. “You can see the other one not moving, not really flinching and accepting it,” says Frank.\nAlmost all of the injured ants that got an amputation from a buddy survived. Meanwhile, ants with leg injuries that were kept away from their nestmates, so that they didn’t get this treatment, frequently died.\nTo see how amputations helped, the researchers experimentally infected open leg wounds on ants with pathogens. They found that the kind of amputations that ants did would stop the infection from spreading and becoming lethal.\nFrank went even further and surgically amputated the ants’ injured legs himself — essentially mimicking the ants’ surgical approach — to see how the amputee fared. That confirmed, he says, “these amputations were saving the lives of the infected individuals.”\nThe research has convinced other ant experts who were not involved in these studies, like Daniel Kronauer of The Rockefeller University. “The experiments are very thorough,” says Kronauer. “To me, it sounds plausible.”\n“Here you have an ant species that lives in a log in my backyard where I grew up in Florida, and they’ve been doing clinical amputation for millions of years, much longer certainly than humans have ever done it,” says Clint Penick, a social insect researcher with Auburn University who also was not involved in this work.\n“It’s really cool to see something like this, and to see really strong research that backs up that this is actually a medical treatment that ants have evolved to do to prevent infection,” says Penick.\nArmed with amputation instincts?\nInterestingly, ants would only perform an amputation when an injury was high up on an ant’s leg, close to the middle of its body. Wounds lower down on the leg didn’t elicit this treatment, although ants would lick at the injuries.\nThat observation prompted Frank’s team to try performing amputations on ants with lower leg injuries that had been infected with bacteria. They found that the ants always died.\nFrank and his colleagues were puzzling over why amputation solely seemed to work for upper-leg injuries, until they closely studied the leg’s anatomy. They saw that muscles in the upper leg normally help move blood-like liquid through an ant’s body. It’s those muscles that get damaged when an upper-leg injury occurs. This means that bacteria or other pathogens in an upper-leg injury would spread to the rest of the body more slowly than they would from a lower-leg injury.\nThe fact that ants only perform amputations in certain circumstances is “really cool,” says Kronauer.\n“They can tell where on the leg the injury has occurred, right? And depending on where exactly the leg has been injured, it makes sense to amputate or it does not make sense to amputate,” he notes.\nStill, he cautions that it’s not like ant medics are evaluating the wound and consciously weighing the pros and cons of treatment options, like a human doctor would.\n“I don't think they have some kind of crazy cognitive capacities,” says Kronauer. “They have basically evolved over like thousands and thousands and probably millions of years to be kind of ‘programmed’ to react to different kinds of injuries in a certain way.”\nEven so, says Penick, humans tend to think that their medicine is uniquely sophisticated, and yet this common backyard ant essentially does surgery.\nAnd even when an ant had a lower-leg injury that could not be treated with amputation, he notes, its nestmates would still tend to the wound, apparently applying some kind of antimicrobial secretions that often proved to be life-saving.\n“My own work shows that a lot of ants produce antimicrobials,” adds Penick, who says amputation “is just another example of things that are in the public health repertoire that ants have to work with.”","extracted_keywords":["ants","leg","amputation","injuries","amputations","treatment","injury","wound","wounds","kind"]}
{"url":"https://www.npr.org/2024/06/07/nx-s1-4994426/wild-elephants-individual-names","title":"Wild elephants may have names  : NPR","extracted_core_text":"Wild elephants may have names that other elephants use to call them\nWild elephants seem to address each other using distinctive, rumbling sounds that could be akin to individual names.\nThat's according to a provocative new study in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution, which was inspired by earlier work showing that bottlenose dolphins have signature whistles.\n\"Sometimes another bottlenose dolphin will imitate somebody else's signature whistle in order to get their attention, so effectively calling them by name,\" says Mickey Pardo, a biologist at Cornell University.\nHe wondered if elephants, which are known to be vocal mimics, might do something similar.\n\"The idea from the outset of this project,\" says Pardo, \"was to try to figure out if elephants have names.\"\nHe means names that the animals call themselves — rather than names like Margaret and Marie that researchers working in nature preserves have given them.\nElephants' trumpeting is well known, but Pardo says trumpeting is an abrupt noise that's more like screaming or laughing. He figured that if elephants had names, they'd be somehow encoded in elephants' constant, low-frequency rumblings.\n\"The rumbles themselves are highly structurally variable,\" says Pardo, who conducted this research while working at Colorado State University. \"There's quite a lot of variation in their acoustic structure.\"\nAnd elephants make these particular noises in all kinds of contexts — everything from greeting family members to comforting a calf to staying in touch with relatives over long distances.\nSo Pardo and some colleagues analyzed recordings of 469 rumbling calls that wild African elephants had made to each other in the Amboseli National Park and Samburu and Buffalo Springs National Reserves in Kenya between 1986 and 2022.\nFor every recorded call, the researchers knew the identity of the elephant making the rumble as well as, based on the context, the elephant that was being addressed.\nIf elephants had names, not every call would be expected to contain one — just like people don't use each other's names every time they speak to each other.\nStill, the research team used machine learning to see if the rumbles contained identifying information — essentially, a \"name\" — that their computer model could learn to use to accurately predict the receiver of a call.\nWhat they found is that their model was able to identify the correct elephant recipient of the call 27.5% of the time, which is much better than it performed during a control analysis that fed it random data, says Pardo.\nThis indicates, he says, that \"there must be something in the calls that's allowing the model to figure out at least some of the time who that call was addressed to.\"\nThe researchers then did some field work to see if 17 elephants — all female except for one — might recognize their own \"names\" and react preferentially to recordings that contained those sounds.\n\"We had to find a situation where a specific elephant was by herself, or at least not with the individual who made the recording,\" he says, explaining that the team would then play the recording through a loudspeaker.\nThey used different recordings on different days. Depending on the day, the elephant would either hear a recorded call that was originally addressed to her or hear a call made by the same elephant that was not intended for her.\nAnd, it turns out, the elephants generally seemed to know when a rumbling message was actually meant for them, suggesting that it contained something like a name. When they heard those calls, they approached the loudspeaker more quickly. They also vocalized a reply more swiftly, and made more response calls.\n\"The elephants responded much more strongly on average to playbacks of calls that were originally addressed to them relative to playbacks of calls from the same caller that were originally addressed to someone else,\" says Pardo.\nThe results of those playback experiments looked \"very convincing,\" says Karl Berg, a biologist at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley.\n\"I have no doubt that they're addressing them with these, you know, unique labels,\" says Berg. \"Now, are they nicknames? Are they names? Where do they come from?\"\nBerg wasn't part of this research team but has studied how wild parrot nestlings acquire unique signature calls, aka names, by slightly modifying the signature call of their caregivers.\nHe notes that in this elephant study, rumbles containing identifying information often seemed to be generated by mothers who were addressing their calves.\n\"A good bit of this was between the moms and their calves,\" says Berg. \"It sure seems like they might be getting it from mom.\"\nSo far, though, no one has been able to figure out exactly what acoustic features in an elephant's low-frequency rumblings might equate to a name.\n\"I'd really like to be able to isolate the name of specific individual elephants,\" says Pardo, \"because if we could do that, we could answer a lot of other questions that we weren't able to fully figure out in this study.\"\nIt's not clear, for example, if elephants all use the same \"name\" when addressing the same recipient. The researchers also don't know if elephants talk about each other in the third person. \"Do they ever use somebody's name when they're not there?\" wonders Pardo.\nBerg notes that animals that use name-like sounds — humans, dolphins, parrots, and now elephants — all are intelligent, long-lived social animals that live in stable groups.\nBut that doesn't mean that all of these creatures use names in exactly the same ways.\n\"People might assume that elephant names work in exactly the same way as human names, which is not necessarily true,\" says Pardo.\nAfter all, he notes, humans and elephants are separated by tens of millions of years of evolution. \"That's a pretty long time.\"","extracted_keywords":["elephants","names","elephant","calls","signature","researchers","time","sounds","study","animals"]}

They dive to the bottom to grab tasty morsels, plus sometimes rocks that they plan to use as tools. They bring these to the surface and float on their backs, using their bellies as tables as they get to work on opening and eating their snacks.\n\"Their preferred prey are usually urchins and abalone,\" says Chris Law, a biologist at the University of Texas and the University of Washington, who notes that urchins and abalone are relatively easy for otters to break apart.\nBut in places where lots of otters are living together in Monterey Bay, \"unfortunately, all those prey items have been declining or have declined,\" says Law.\nHe says there are areas with an over-abundance of urchins — the so called \"urchin barrens\" where urchins have eaten all the kelp. Since the kelp is gone, however, these urchins no longer have a good food supply and are thus calorie-poor. They offer little nutritional value for otters, which aren't interested in consuming these so-called \"zombie urchins.\"\n\"So that means otters have to eat alternative foods,\" says Law. \"A lot of those alternative foods are those super-hard-shell prey items that really require some kind of external force to break into.\"\nSnails, for example, are abundant in the bay, but they're low-calorie and \"basically like a rock that you have to break into to eat the insides,\" says Law.\nWhile sea otters are known for using tools, not all individuals actually wield them. Some otters forgo them entirely and simply specialize in eating soft prey. Some otters use tools occasionally, while others use them most of the time that they're foraging for food.\n\"We were interested in this tool use variation,\" says Law, so he and some colleagues analyzed data on 196 otters in California.\nThese tagged otters get closely monitored by volunteer \"otter spotters.\" That means researchers know what they're eating, how big and hard the prey is, and whether the otter used a tool to eat it.\nIt turns out that frequent tool users were able to eat harder and larger prey, according to a report in the journal Science. This was particularly important for female otters, since they're smaller than males and aren't able to bite down with as much force.\n\"They typically wouldn't be able to break into harder prey,\" says Law. \"But they use tools more than males, so they're able to gain access to these novel sources of food items.\"\nWhat's more, using tools protected the otters' teeth. The researchers were able to get dental assessments on their otters and found that tool users had less dental damage from crunching down on hard shells.\n\"Without their teeth, they clearly can't eat anything. So then they die. What we're suggesting is that this behavior really allowed them to continue living on despite not having their preferred prey,\" says Law.\nHe explains that some otters learn to specialize in eating hard, low-calorie snails, using tools very frequently to \"basically become really, really, really good at processing lots and lots and lots of snails every day,\" instead of searching for high-calorie foods that don't require tools to open but are in short supply.\n\"This is such an important paper,\" says Rob Shumaker, president and CEO of the Indianapolis Zoo and one of the authors of a book called Animal Tool Behavior.\nHe says scientists have spent decades documenting tool use in dozens of species; tool use in sea otters, for example, has been recognized since the 1960s. But now, studies like this one are showing that this field of research is starting to shift.\n\"It's not about describing the actual tool use or tool manufacture anymore,\" says Shumaker. \"It's describing the impact that it has on that animal's life.\"","extracted_keywords":["otters","tools","prey","tool","sea","foods","use","food","urchins","lots"]}

In 2019, Biological Conservation reported that 40% of all insects species are declining globally and that a third of them are endangered.\nAnd while it may sound nice to live in a world with fewer roaches, environmental writer Oliver Milman says that human beings would be in big trouble without insects. That's because insects play critical roles in pollinating plants we eat, breaking down waste in forest soil and forming the base of a food chain that other, larger animals — including humans — rely upon.\n\"It would be an extremely dire place to live in — and certainly not something we should ever aim for,\" Milman says of an insect-free existence. \"You would certainly have mass starvation [and] societal unrest ..... It'd be a place where there would be rotting feces and corpses everywhere because dung beetles and other insects that break down those materials would be gone.\"\nMilman charts the troubling decline of insects in his new book, The Insect Crisis: The Fall of the Tiny Empires That Run the World. He says that while it's impossible to know exactly what's happening with every insect species in the world, the overall trends are not good: The monarch butterfly population in North America has plummeted in the past 40 years, for instance, and a U.N. assessment done in 2019 found that half a million insect species are under threat of extinction, some in the coming decades.\n\"The world, our surroundings, would be far quieter, far duller, far drabber without insects,\" he says. \"When you start kind of digging down into these figures looking at the research, it's clear that there's something seriously amiss. ... There is a consistent decline in most insect populations, and that spells major trouble for them but also for us.\"\nInterview highlights\nOn what the loss of pollinators means\nYou've got some places in China where the loss of insects is so great that armies of people have been told to ... fan out and go through orchards with ... paint brushes and feathers on sticks to pollinate crops by hand — a hugely ... labor intensive operation that obviously isn't really sustainable long-term. We need the insects around to do these jobs as they've done them for millions of years.\nSo there is this growing ... rumble of concern about food insecurity, especially when you think about what's happening with the overall trends. I mean, the world's population is growing. There's been a ... 300% increase in the volume of agricultural production dependent on animal pollination in the last 50 years. So we're losing pollinators at a time when we're demanding more and more pollination. We have more mouths to feed. We need more farmland. We need more intensively farmed farmland. At this kind of crucial moment, we're losing the pollinators that do that for us.\nOn the variety of insects that serve as pollinators\nBees get a lot of the focus and the attention when it comes to pollination, but there's a whole array of insects that provide that pollination service. In fact, three-quarters of the world's flowering plants and about a third of the world's food crops depend on pollinators at some stage. And so it's not just bees .... Flies are huge pollinators. That includes the midges that pollinate the cocoa crop that chocolate comes from. And there are wasps as well. Wasps are major pollinators. Again, another insect that's widely disliked but actually crucial for our environment.\nWithout these creatures, we would be without apples, cranberries, melons, almonds, broccoli, blueberries, cherries, I mean, the list goes on and on. We'd even be without ice cream, because alfalfa ... that is fed to cows ... is [pollinated by insects]. So we'd be without many of the kind of staples of our lives, many of the luxuries of our lives. Curries would become a historical dish, because cardamom would not be there, cumin would not be there. Many spices — many of the things that make our diets kind of colorful, interesting and nutritious — would be stripped from our lives without insects. That's a really important thing to think about when we're thinking about pollinator declines because many of the world's poor rely upon agriculture that's directly pollinated in their immediate surroundings, and without that, all of the nutrition is stripped from their diets. Malnutrition rates start to climb. ...The U.N. has warned that this is going to become a food security issue, something that the world needs to focus on quite acutely.\nOn the importance of the insects at the base of the food chain\nOnce you kind of yank insects out of the base of the food chain, everything kind of starts toppling away from above them, really. They're crucial in terms of just the basic foundations of forests and grassland ecosystems. We think about the placement of soil as a cycling of nitrogen through the soils that ensures that plants grow.\nWe may hate mosquitoes, but they provide a huge amount of food to frogs and then also birds. Once you start climbing up the food chain, you start affecting things that we really do value. So, as well as these declines that have been documented in insects, bird numbers have been reported to be down in several countries, and the birds that eat insects are faring far worse than the birds that are omnivorous, such as crows, for example. They provide a really important base to the food pyramid, and they provide a really crucial part of our overall environment.\nOn some extraordinary things that insects can do\nI'm a very big fan of the caterpillars that can generate their own antifreeze to ward off the cold. That seems like an incredible ability to me. There's the water beetle that, once it's eaten by a frog, can actually escape from the frogs' rear end, to actually escape being eaten by the frog. Even insects that we revile are extremely impressive when you think about them objectively. Cockroaches can last two weeks after being beheaded. They can run at incredible speeds. They can survive huge amounts of poison and radiation, even.\nBees themselves are just incredible creatures just in terms of their logistical work, their ability to organize socially. Honeybees can understand the concept of zero and can add and subtract numbers. You have bumblebees that researchers have found can play soccer. They can learn to play soccer with food rewards, and there are bees that can detect landmines as well. There's all kinds of incredible things that they can do with their minds, for such small creatures. And so the more you learn about, I think, the more you're enamored with them and the warmer you feel by insects, the more you discover how incredible they really are.\nOn insect habitat loss\nWhen we think about habitat loss, we think about the idea of the Amazon rainforest being burned down or chopped down. But a lot of the habitat loss is far more mundane. It's the conversion of a barren piece of land or seemingly barren piece of land into a Starbucks. It's the conversion of a field where wildflowers will grow into a field of soy or corn or another single crop. It's largely driven by agriculture. Some of it is also driven by urban sprawl. These are the laying down of highways, heavy industry and so on. So it's obviously a model that's exploded in Europe and North America, and that model is being transported elsewhere. You're seeing other countries adopt this method of farming large fields of single crops, dousing them with insecticides and other chemicals in order to boost their yields. So a lot of what we consider unproductive grounds, messy land, the kind of stuff the place is filled with wildflowers, with scrub, with kind of brambles and weeds, we call them weeds when they're in fact actually really important food providers for insects.\nLauren Krenzel and Seth Kelley produced and edited this interview for broadcast.

{"url":"https://www.npr.org/transcripts/nx-s1-5304434","title":"What DOGE cuts could mean for national park visitors : NPR","extracted_core_text":"ADRIAN FLORIDO, HOST:\nMany federal jobs that the Trump administration has eliminated are for government work done behind the scenes, but downsizing at the National Park Service affects people quite literally at the scenes. In the Southwest, people are taking notice even before spring break and summer vacations. KUER's David Condos reports from Zion National Park in Utah.\nDAVID CONDOS, BYLINE: This is typically the slow season at Zion National Park, but on a recent Saturday morning, there's a long line of cars waiting to get in. Just two of the four entrance stations at the park's main gate are open. Now, it's unclear if that's due to the National Park Service jobs President Trump cut. The White House isn't confirming details about it, but Democratic lawmakers and employee groups say it's about a thousand jobs nationwide. Zion National Park declined to comment. People around here are worried, though.\nBARBARA BRUNO: Today is just a day in February, and look at the line. So it's - we're more concerned about the - not the big holidays, but the everyday kind of traffic and congestion that we might experience.\nCONDOS: Barbara Bruno is the mayor of Springdale, the town closest to Zion's main entrance. She says around a dozen Zion rangers lost their jobs, and the long line of cars to get into the park is backed up into town, where locals are protesting.\nUNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting) Take a stand, protect the land.\nCONDOS: More than 100 people chant and carry signs against a backdrop of towering red-rock peaks. They're upset about the firings, and worry about what that means for the future of public lands. Local business owner Jaechon Anderson organized the protest.\nJAECHON ANDERSON: I truly believe that all Americans love the parks, and so we're here today fighting for them, fighting for their future. Mother Nature doesn't have her own voice, so she needs us right now.\nCONDOS: Visitor numbers start rising dramatically in March here. Last year, nearly 5 million people came to Zion. On busy days, Mayor Bruno says the line of cars can block Springdale residents from their homes and make it hard for emergency vehicles to get through. She says firing so many workers also makes it hard for staff who remain on the job.\nBRUNO: They're beloved members of our community, and I feel for them. I think that they're all sort of worried about what the future holds, and the park was already understaffed and underfunded.\n(SOUNDBITE OF FOOTSTEPS)\nCONDOS: Inside Zion, Helena Parks is taking a photo. She's visiting from California and says she's a federal worker, too. Overall, she agrees with the job cuts.\nHELENA PARKS: The new presidency comes in, they're trying to do something good. Not everybody sees it that way, but it's an action.\nCONDOS: While losing park jobs is unfortunate, she says, it may be a necessary part of reining in the federal budget. But Bill Wade, the head of the Association of National Park Rangers, expects tourists to notice the reduced staffing, from shorter hours at visitor centers to dirtier bathrooms.\nBILL WADE: When you use a broadsword instead of a scalpel to go through a thousand positions and indiscriminately terminate them, I just don't see that as being the efficient way to do things.\nCONDOS: A memo obtained by NPR says the Park Service has permission to hire a larger number of seasonal staff than in previous years, but Wade says...\nWADE: I think it's unlikely that all of those seasonals are going to be hired and onboard before the heavy-use season actually gets underway.\nCONDOS: In the meantime, unions have filed lawsuits over how the Trump administration eliminated jobs, including at the Park Service. Now, many of the fired workers were probationary, meaning they were new to the agency or had recently started new roles there. One of them was Macie Monahan, a biologist at Utah's Bryce Canyon National Park.\nMACIE MONAHAN: When I got removed from my position illegally, I was 10 days away from being off my probationary period. I was hoping and praying that it wouldn't happen.\nCONDOS: But then she got the mass termination email that went out on Valentine's Day. It told her she was fired for poor performance, even though she says her reviews were positive.\nMONAHAN: I wasn't slacking off and wasting taxpayer money. I was out in the field for 10 hours a day. I was working in unstable weather conditions or getting down and dirty with some prairie dogs at times. You know, I'm out in the field doing hard work.\nCONDOS: So getting that email hurt. She worries it'll end up hurting the parks, too. Monahan says Bryce Canyon was already short-staffed relative to its millions of visitors, so she and the other rangers often worked above and beyond to keep it running.\nMONAHAN: My passions are still there, and, you know, I hope and pray we can kind of get back to what we were doing before, eventually.\nCONDOS: Until then, she's not sure what will happen to the projects she was working on.

{"url":"https://www.npr.org/transcripts/1171357002","title":"FDA considers new muscular dystrophy treatment using experimental gene therapy : Shots - Health News : NPR","extracted_core_text":"Gene therapy for muscular dystrophy stirs hopes and controversy\nJUANA SUMMERS, HOST:\nThe Food and Drug Administration is trying to decide whether to approve the first gene therapy for the most common form of muscular dystrophy. That's generating excitement among parents of children stricken by the devastating muscle disease. But it's also raising concerns about how the FDA is evaluating the treatment. NPR health correspondent Rob Stein reports.\nROB STEIN, BYLINE: Susan Finazzo and her husband noticed their older son Chase was pretty clumsy when he was just a few years old, but they didn't think it was anything serious.\nSUSAN FINAZZO: Like, he would fall a lot - not, like, a lot, a lot. But, like, he had trouble climbing playground equipment. He fell down the stairs at his preschool a couple of times.\nSTEIN: Chase's little brother, Dylan, was more agile but started walking a little late.\nFINAZZO: We're not thinking anything of it. He's just got some weak ankles. He's got some little - tiny little orthotics for toddlers. And we're just kind of going through the motions. He sees an orthopedic surgeon. Like, we've got PT. We're all over it.\nSTEIN: So they were stunned when doctors told them both boys had Duchenne muscular dystrophy. It's the most common neuromuscular disorder in children. It almost exclusively affects boys, destroying their muscles. Most end up in wheelchairs before they become teenagers. Eventually, their hearts and lungs give out. Most die in their 30s and 40s. It's incurable.\nFINAZZO: It's absolutely devastating. You end up going through a mourning process. You're mourning the loss of the life that your child should have had. You sit there, and you wonder, is my child ever going to - are they going to be able to go to college? Are they going to live that long? Are they going to be able to fall in love, have children of their own? You thought you were going to have soccer practices, and now you're wondering, how much time do I have with them?\nSTEIN: Finazzo and her husband, who live in Miami, eventually volunteered Chase, who's now 8, and Dylan, who's now 5, for a study testing an experimental gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy.\nFINAZZO: I'm just so excited that we even got the opportunity to take part in this. This is a really amazing opportunity.\nSTEIN: The gene therapy works by giving one infusion of trillions of harmless viruses that have been genetically modified to ferry a gene to kid's muscles. The gene produces a miniature version of a protein boys with muscular dystrophy are missing, known as dystrophin. The hope is this micro-dystrophin will slow the progression of the disease.\nFINAZZO: I hope that this can extend their lives a little bit. I mean, at the end of the day, as a Duchenne parent, you don't even care about the wheelchair anymore. You don't care about the not walking. I just want them to be alive longer. I want them to be alive long enough to enjoy what life is.\nSTEIN: But Sarepta, the company that developed the treatment, wants the FDA to approve the gene therapy largely based on how much micro-dystrophin it produces in patients' muscles through a program that lets the FDA accelerate their approval of new treatments before conclusive evidence is available that it's actually helping patients. Douglas Ingram is Sarepta's CEO.\nDOUGLAS INGRAM: We're dealing with a very serious, rare disease, a deadly disease. Every day matters to these patients. We have, at least from our perspective, a perfect opportunity to use the accelerated approval pathway.\nSTEIN: But this accelerated approval pathway is controversial because some companies fail to follow through on their promises to confirm their treatments work. And some treatments have been later withdrawn after turning out to be useless. Sarepta's gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy would be the first gene therapy approved this way. Dr. Reshma Ramachandran studies drug approvals at the Yale School of Medicine. She says Sarepta has already failed to complete the required follow-up studies for three drugs for muscular dystrophy.\nRESHMA RAMACHANDRAN: We're still left uncertain whether or not these very expensive treatments actually yield a meaningful clinical benefit or if we're just simply still guessing. This question has been looming since 2016. Is dystrophin an appropriate proxy measure for clinical benefit for Duchenne muscular dystrophy? That's still a looming question. And the fact that it's, you know, seven years later and we still don't have an answer is a bit appalling.\nSTEIN: If it turns out not to help, Ramachandran worries the approval could discourage the development of other treatments that could work and preclude patients from being eligible for those therapies. Dr. Glen Nuckolls at the National Institutes of Health wouldn't comment directly on Sarepta's requests but also has questions.\nGLEN NUCKOLLS: There's certainly data to suggest that you start making dystrophin, it's going to result in regeneration of the tissue and increased strength. But I think the relationship of what exact level is needed - we'd probably like to have some more data on that.\nSTEIN: But Douglas Ingram from Sarepta says children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy can't afford to wait.\nINGRAM: We could wait. During that period of waiting, some 6 to 800 kids will die. Some 6 to 800 kids will be consigned to a power wheelchair for the rest of their lives. Six to 800 kids will be consigned to permanent ventilation. All of these kids will be irreparably damaged in ways that we won't be able to reverse.\nSTEIN: And the company says it has preliminary data indicating the treatment is helping kids. The company's request has won support from groups like the Muscular Dystrophy Association. Debra Miller heads CureDuchenne, another group that helped fund Sarepta.\nDEBRA MILLER: We believe that it is slowing the disease and hopefully stabilizing these patients. A lot is going to depend, I think, upon the age at which they're dosed. But we have high hopes that, at least for many years, we'll be able to arrest the downward progression of this disease through gene therapy.\nSTEIN: Susan Finazzo just hopes it'll help her sons and other boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.\nFINAZZO: Birthdays are especially hard because they're bittersweet. You're so happy, but then you're also knowing that that's one less year with them. That's just a reminder of the clock that's ticking. As happy as you are, they're so happy to be older, and here you are so upset that it's just one year less with them.\nSTEIN: Independent advisers to the FDA are meeting May 12 to decide whether to recommend the agency approve the company's request. The FDA has until the end of May to make a decision about what could be the first gene therapy for muscular dystrophy. Rob Stein, NPR News.\nCopyright © 2023 NPR. All rights reserved.

But not anymore.\n\"It's been absolutely brilliant and life-changing for me,\" says Grehan, 26, of Billinge in North West England. He received an experimental gene therapy in 2017 that, at least for now, has eliminated his need for regular injections. \"I can just go about my day and not have to worry.\"\nBased on experiences like Grehan's, the company that developed the therapy is seeking approval in Europe and the United States to start selling the first gene therapy for hemophilia. That's generating excitement among patients, patient advocates and doctors.\n\"Not to have to worry about hemophilia any longer — I think it's essentially transformational for many patients,\" says Dr. John Pasi of the Royal London Hospital and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry. Pasi led the recently published study Grehan took part in.\nOthers are more cautious.\n\"This is really exciting, but also raises a lot of questions,\" says Meg Bradbury, director of research at the Hemophilia Federation of America, a patient advocacy group.\nOne of the biggest questions is the possible cost. BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. of San Rafael, Calif., the company that developed the gene therapy, says the treatment could cost as much as $3 million per patient, which would make it the most expensive drug ever approved.\n\"It's just outrageous,\" says Peter Bach, who studies drug prices at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York.\nCompany officials defend the possible price, however. It currently costs hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to treat each hemophilia patient. The gene therapy would, researchers hope, be a one-time treatment that lasts a lifetime.\n\"The context is this gigantically expensive disease to treat,\" says Jeff Ajer, BioMarin's executive vice president and chief commercial officer. \"It's likely that our gene therapy would save a lot of money — millions, perhaps many millions.\"\nHemophilia is a relatively rare condition. Hemophilia A, the most common form of the disease, occurs in 1 of about every 5,000 boys. (Though girls can be born with hemophilia, too, that's much rarer.) People born with the condition are missing a crucial protein that their blood needs to clot. So doing things as simple as walking can cause dangerous bleeding in their joints that eventually can be crippling.\n\"It was quite difficult, because I was always getting these bleeds in the ankles,\" Grehan says. \"So walking around was becoming more and more troublesome.\"\nGrehan has a severe form of hemophilia A, which causes a deficiency in a clotting protein called factor VIII.\n\"It's the microbleeds that just sort of wear your down — not even physically but mentally,\" Grehan says.\nAnd Grehan knew that propensity to bleed could cause even more serious, possibly fatal, complications if the hemorrhage every happened in his brain or other parts of his body.\n\"Internally, there could have been a lot worse situations,\" Grehan says. \"I consider myself quite lucky in that respect.\"\nBefore anything like that happened to Grehan, he learned that doctors were testing the gene therapy.\n\"When I first heard about the trial I thought it was unbelievable that we were in this situation — that this even existed,\" Grehan says.\nSo he volunteered three years ago to let doctors infuse trillions of neutralized viruses that had been genetically engineered to carry the healthy gene he needed into his liver.\nWithin a couple of weeks, Grehan could stop injecting himself with the clotting protein that he had previously needed.\nIn fact, the treatment dramatically cut bleeding in all 13 of the patients who got the effective dose of gene therapy determined by the study Grehan was in.\n\"I think it's amazing data actually,\" Pasi says. \"It's been the Holy Grail for years to be able to treat hemophilia with a gene therapy treatment. And maybe we're beginning to see that that wasn't a pipe dream — that this is a realistic option.\"\nIt's the latest promising development for gene therapy, which has finally started producing effective treatments for a variety of diseases after decades of setbacks.\nSeveral other experimental forms of gene therapy are also showing promise for hemophilia, including another type of the condition, known as hemophilia B.\nSo far, nearly 150 patients have been treated with BioMarin's gene therapy as part of a larger study, and the results continue to be encouraging, according to the company. Some patients having been followed for as long as four years.\n\"For a good fraction of these people, they don't have to even think about having hemophilia anymore,\" says Henry Fuchs, president of research and development at BioMarin.\nThe Food and Drug Administration has designated the treatment a \"breakthrough\" therapy and accepted the company's application to give the gene therapy priority status for evaluation, representatives of BioMarin say. That makes it the first gene therapy for hemophilia the agency has agreed to consider.\nAccording to the company, the FDA has signaled it will make its decision by Aug. 21 about whether to approve the treatment for sale.\nLonger studies will be need to determine if the treatment is, in fact, a one-time, therapy for lifelong effect, experts say.\n\"It seems to be working very well, but we are only at three years,\" says Dr. W. Keith Hoots, director of the division of blood diseases and resources at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. \"We need to know for sure whether it will extend for their entire life. And only time will tell for that.\"\nNevertheless, Bach agrees the treatment appears very promising. Still, he questions the price tag, which would be just the latest in what appears to be an ongoing rise in the cost of the new wave of genetic therapies.\n\"The clinical breakthrough is prodigious.

Then they went on a safari ...\nThe guide starts up the Land Rover, then calls for attention from his excited passengers.\n\"All right, We're going into the bush!\"\nWe're at the gateway to Botswana's safari country – one of the most glamorous tourist destinations in the world. But this isn't one of the $5,800-per-day excursions for international visitors that this guide normally leads.\nThis is a field trip for about 35 sixth graders from a village of mud-walled huts.\nThe village is called Habu, and you won't find it on Google maps. There are no paved roads here. No shops. And almost no jobs. Most of the 800 or so people who live in Habu survive on unemployment checks worth about $2 a day – supplemented by crops that they grow in their gardens, and a few cattle that they raise at posts in the wilderness surrounding the village.\nThe safari guide, Moreetsi Tsile, asks the kids which animal they're most hoping to see.\n\"Tau!\" they call out in Botswana's Tswana language. \"Ah,\" says Tsile, laughing, \"the lion!\"\nBut the focus of this drive is actually an animal these kids are a lot more familiar with – elephants.\nThis field trip is the high point of one nonprofit's multi-pronged effort to shift the dynamics of a delicate conflict:\nBotswana is home to one the world's last thriving populations of wild elephants. At more than 130,000, it's the largest in any country. But as the elephants' habitat has shrunk, and the number of people in Botswana has grown, this region has become an epicenter of a clash between humans and wildlife that's threatening all sides.\nI ask the kids if anyone has had a personal encounter with an elephant. The hands go up.\nA tall boy named Fortune Kalafo is the first to share, even though he's so shy he squeezes his eyes shut as he speaks.\nIn a halting whisper he explains that his family grows maize and pumpkins on their land. And the elephants are always coming in to eat the crop — ruining it before it can be harvested. When his parents see elephants they beat drums to scare them. But the elephants keep coming back.\nA few months ago, says Fortune in Tswana, \"my uncle went after the elephants with a gun.\"\nAnother boy – this one with a huge, confident grin – waves for my attention. His name is Kaurihongua Ngaazire. He says that just a few days ago he and his older brothers were on their donkeys, picking the tiny, sweet-tasting orange fruits from what's called a Shepherd's tree, when a herd of elephants passed by.\nKaurihongua and his brothers set their dogs after the elephants, hoping to shoo them off. Instead, one of the elephants – a mother protecting her calf – turned around and started charging at the dogs. \"We had to race into the house to escape it,\" says Kaurihongua in Tswana.\nBut it's a girl with a grave expression named Lorato Andreck who describes the most serious encounter. She says she was visiting her grandmother in a nearby town a few months ago, when she heard screams.\n\"People saying, 'Elephant! Elephant!' \" she recalls.\nA large male had wandered directly past the house. Lorato watched as her uncle, who had an intellectual disability, approached it – and the elephant attacked.\n\"Took him, threw him, hit the house, took him again,\" she says.\n\"People were screaming, 'Hey! The elephant is killing somebody! The elephant is killing somebody!' \"\nHe was dead in minutes.\nA new view of elephants\nToday's safari drive is about trying to see elephants in a different light.\nThe Land Rover lurches forward.\n\"Vroom!\" shouts Kaurihongua \"Go ... to ... elephants!\"\nSoon we're speeding through the flat scrubland, past towering termite mounds. An acacia tree's thorny branches scrape the sides of the truck, sending the kids ducking and squealing with delight.\nKaurihongua calls down to the girl Lorato, sitting in a front seat: \"You've got so many leaves in your hair!\" They collapse into giggles.\nWhen he's in a classroom Kaurihongua struggles. In fact, his grades are so low his teacher worries he'll drop out before high school. But he has bigger goals: \"I want to get into BU,\" he says – Botswana University – \"then become a teacher.\" And out here on safari, he's the most outgoing, engaged kid in the truck, calling out landmarks as we pass them as though he were a guide himself:\n\"Garden!\" Kaurihongua shouts, pointing out a communal garden. It's surrounded by the kind of metal fencing that people here usually can't afford. It's been newly built with the help of Wild Entrust, the nonprofit dedicated to conservation that has organized today's safari drive. Xigera Safari Lodge – a luxury outfitter that lent its guides to lead the drive – is also contributing funds to the garden. The plan is for the villagers to eventually earn money by becoming one of Xigera's vegetable suppliers.\n\"Trust! Trust of Habu!\" Kaurihongua exclaims next, as the truck rumbles through a gate and pulls to a stop. We're now on a vast tract of land managed by a community trust.\nWild Entrust, the nonprofit, is also working with Habu's leaders here – hiring scouts who will be scoping out locations for campsites and a new road network so the community trust can eventually open a safari business on the land. It will most likely be a no frills set-up for tourists driving in with their own vehicles. But they're hoping it will bring in yet more jobs and income.\nA woman approaches the Land Rover with some water bottles. \"Hey guys!\" she says as she passes them out to the kids. \"Did you see the termite mounds?\"\nShe's Lesley McNutt, a Canadian anthropologist who co-founded Wild Entrust. McNutt says the garden effort and the camping safari business are among a raft of projects the nonprofit is collaborating on with Habu's leaders in order to meet two simultaneous goals: alleviate Habu's pervasive poverty; and protect elephants and other wildlife by making it easier for villagers to at least co-exist with the animals – and ideally make a living off them.\nYet after decades of researching and working on conservation in Botswana, McNutt has also concluded that even when people have those kinds of economic interests for safeguarding wildlife, it's often not enough.\n\"I was looking at, so for example, a cheetah eats your cow – What do you do?\" says McNutt. \"Do you apply for compensation [from the government]? Do you go out of your way to try to corral your cattle differently? Or do you shoot the cheetah?\"\n\"What I found was, even though people understood there was monetary value coming back to them from the [wildlife] tourism industry – were even employed in the tourism industry – there wasn't any shift in behavior when there were situations of conflict.\"\nInstead, McNutt reasoned, what really makes the difference is when people also have empathy for the animals. The kind of appreciation and even cherishing that, she thought, could come from studying them from childhood.\nAnd so, over the last several years McNutt has been developing an educational program that's now delivered to every primary school in this province of Botswana, starting in fifth grade and running through seventh. Each year Wild Entrust staffers, or \"coaches\" as the nonprofit refers to them, come in to give a lesson on a different endangered animal – not just elephants but for instance, vultures, wild dogs and rhinos. They talk to the kids about the ways the animal benefits Botswana's ecosystem as well the challenges it faces. Then they play specially designed games in which the kids are encouraged to identify with the animal by emulating its qualities on the sports field.\nIn most cases these sessions consist of a two-and-half hour visit. But for a handful of schools, McNutt has raised enough money to add on what she considers the ideal pairing: a day-long safari drive.\n\"You can sit in a classroom, you can learn for months and months,\" she says, \"and it may not have as much impact as one day on the back of a vehicle seeing an elephant in terms of changing your worldview about caring about them. It's the aha moment. It's a trigger. It's a switch. Because they're impressive. They're amazing!\"\nHow to react when you see an elephant\nAnd the awe is certainly there as the truck starts up again ... and the kids spot the first wild animal of the drive: A species of antelope with impressively large spiraled horns called a kudu.\n\"Wow!\" says Fortune Kalafo, the shy boy. He is especially transformed – his reserve melting away as he shouts out the names of the creatures bounding past.\n\"Impala!\" he calls out.\n\"Or maybe a Springbok?\" says another kid.\n\"Definitely impala,\" says Fortune.\nHe's always loved animals. Especially rabbits. They're so clever, he says.\nThe animals are coming ever faster now.\n\"Springbok!\" intones one of the guides, Ike Mogalakwe, pointing.\n\"Springbok!\" the kids repeat in unison.\nBut what about the main object of this safari – the elephants?\nMogalakwe slows the truck as he spots some fresh tracks. \"Yeah, on the right hand side. At the bottom,\" he says. \"Evidence of an elephant that was here.\"\nLorato purses her lips. Her mother is one of the teachers at the school. So her house is a step up from the other kids' — it's brick instead of mud and thatch. Still she dreams of getting away from Habu. So boring, she says.\nShe leans forward and taps Mogalakwe on the shoulder.\n\"What is the safe thing to do when you see an elephant?\" she asks.\n\"Don't run!\" says Mogalakwe.\n\"Stand like a statue?\" says Lorato.\n\"Yeah, stand still. Don't run,\" he answers.\nTheir elephant encounter\nSoon after, the kids get to put that advice into practice when they pull up to a waterhole for a lollipop break.\nSuddenly a huge elephant ambles over ... and starts to drink.\nMogalakwe motions for silence.\n\"I want you to come down one by one,\" he whispers. \"But very quietly.\"\nLorato is the last to climb out of the truck.\nShe gives a nervous chuckle. \"I'm a little bit scared.\"\n\"Okay,\" says Mogalakwe. \"Let's go together. SLOWLY.\"\nHe steps closer and closer to the elephant – the kids creeping behind him. Then he motions for a halt.\n\"So you should never give elephants your scent,\" he says. The key, he explains, is to remain downwind.\nHe picks up some sand from the ground and slowly releases it. \"It will show you the wind is blowing that way,\" he says.\nThen Mogalakwe gets to the heart of the lesson: If you approach the elephant this way, it's a calm animal.\n\"We are still here,\" he notes. \"And look how long we've been here.\"\nAs the kids suck on their lollipops, Mogalakwe starts to point out all the cool features of this elephant: The finger-like projections at the end of its trunk. How its ears are shaped like the continent of Africa.\n\"Right at the bottom, this is where Botswana is,\" he says.\nAll of the things stacked\nOn the ride home the atmosphere is giddy as the kids rehash every moment, the details growing in the re-telling. \"It was humongous!\" says Kaurihongua in Tswana, \"A beast!\"\nThe rest of the afternoon passes in a whirl of further diversions: A helicopter lands in the field by the school to whisk the guides from Xigera back to their lodge as the kids cheer. One of Wild Entrust's coaches passes out new activity books on elephants as another, Lefentse Oscar Xhao, goes through the highlights: \"See how when the elephant digs that hole, when it rains it will create more space for water collection,\" he says, \"and that means more animals will benefit.\"\nAnd there is game after game. \"Okay guys, get inside this circle,\" says Xhao, the coach. \"You are elephants and imagine around you this is a river infested with crocodiles.\" The challenge is to grab water bottles outside the circle beyond the reach of any one kid. The children try forming a chain, hanging on to the leg of a girl at the end so she can dangle forward over the edge of the circle. \"What are you going to use that you learned from elephants?\" says Xhao, shouting over the shrieks and giggles. \"Teamwork!\"\nMcNutt maintains that these exercises are essential to expanding the initial connection that kids can feel when they watch an animal on safari into a deeper, more durable interest in protecting wildlife. \"You have this amazing experience,\" of effectively meeting the animal in a new way, she says. Then, through play, \"you mimic those characteristic behaviors of the animal and you think, 'Wow, I can actually learn something from an elephant.' Because of all those connections you come out the other end in a relationship of empathy.\"\nAnd McNutt stresses that the shift is a cumulative process, as the seventh grade sessions move into more brainstorming on actions kids can take to help animals. \"It's a combination of all of the things stacked,\" she says.\nWhat did the kids make of it?\nThe next day I meet up with the kids back at their school to find out what the takeaway was for them.\nLorato ticks off facts she learned. \"Elephants are smart and they beautify the country,\" she says.\nAnd she tells me she appreciated the tips on how to stay safe. \"I feel like I can be brave now and not be afraid of elephants,\" she says.\nBut it hasn't changed her opinion of them.\n\"Yes, I can protect myself from elephants,\" she says. \"But love them – No! I don't like elephants at all. I hate them.\"\nKaurihongua, the outgoing boy who had set his dogs on elephants, says he won't ever do that again. Now he feels sorry for elephants. \"We're always taunting them,\" he says.\nBut what about the very rational fear that people in Habu have when they run into an elephant, I ask. \"What's the solution?\"\nKaurihongua sighs heavily. \"None,\" he says.\nAnd then there's Fortune, the shy animal lover.\nHe says watching that elephant on the safari changed his thinking. He'd never seen an elephant so calm.\n\"I was surprised that if you don't provoke it, It won't harm you,\" he says.\nHe talks of becoming a soldier, \"because they watch over and protect animals.\" And he muses about solutions to the elephant problem in Habu. \"Maybe we could dig waterholes for them,\" he says. Away from our fields?\nBecause Fortune still doesn't see people and elephants coexisting in Habu itself.\n\"Most people, when they see the elephants, they'll want to chase them off,\" he says.\nBut Fortune says he is going to talk to his own family. Tell them, when the elephants come by, let's not do things that just rile them up, like beating the drums.\n\"Do you think they will listen to you?\" I ask. \"I mean, you're a kid.\"\nHe nods.\n\"My mother will,\" he says.","extracted_keywords":["elephants","elephant","kids","people","animal","animals","drive","truck","safari","day"]}

She's an attorney and Yurok Tribe member who has played a critical role in advocating for dam removal. As water poured through the tunnel, she could hear boulders rolling and tumbling. The water turned to dark chocolate milk as decades of pent-up sediment surged through.\n\"This is historic and life-changing,\" Cordalis said. \"And it means that the Yurok people have a future. It means the river has a future; the salmon have a future.\"\nMike Belchik, a senior policy adviser for the Yurok Tribe, was also there to witness the controlled breach.\n\"It's kind of surreal,\" said Belchik, who has worked on Klamath River water issues for the tribe for nearly 30 years. \"I don't know why we had such confidence that it was going to happen. But we did. We always knew it would happen.\"\nOne hundred seventy-three feet high, with a 740-foot crest, Iron Gate is an earth embankment dam with a skinny, many-fingered reservoir behind it. The lowering — or drawdown — of Iron Gate and two other reservoirs on the Klamath River will make way for the removal of three remaining hydroelectric dams that are part of the Lower Klamath Project in Northern California and southern Oregon.\nFor decades, these barriers have blocked salmon, steelhead and Pacific lamprey from accessing habitat above them and contributed to poor water quality below. The Klamath River was once the third-largest salmon producer on the West Coast, but in the time since the dams were constructed, the Klamath's coho and Chinook runs have dwindled to a fraction of their historic abundance.\nWhen tribal activists first started calling for the removal of four Klamath River dams in the late 1990s, people thought they were \"crazy,\" said Leaf Hillman, an elder of the Karuk Tribe who helped launch the campaign. \"We've never really considered any other alternative to removing dams. And so it was a fight that we were committed to, and that we knew that we had to win. And it's been an intergenerational struggle.\"\nA massive die-off of Chinook salmon in 2002 catalyzed increased activism around getting the dams removed. An estimated 34,000 to 78,000 fish died. The loss of these fish didn't just mean the loss of a fun summer fishing activity, said Brook Thompson, a Yurok Tribe member who was 7 years old at the time and is now in her late 20s. \"Those salmon to me are the connections I have with my relatives,\" she explained. \"In a day, that was all gone.\"\nThe fight to save the Klamath River's salmon shaped the lives and careers of people like Thompson, who grew up holding up posters at protests. Today, she is pursuing a Ph.D. that focuses, in part, on how to incorporate Native knowledge into policy. For her, it all comes back to the river and the fish that are so central to Native diets, ceremonies and identity.\n\"Yurok spirituality and Yurok ways of life cannot exist without having the salmon here,\" she said.\nWhile activists celebrate the rebirth of a river, the massive project brings uncertainty to others, particularly residents who live near the dams. In the small town of Copco Lake, Calif., losing their namesake lake means losing the centerpiece of their community. It also brings heightened concerns about how the reshaped landscape will affect their property values and their ability to safeguard their homes from wildfires in a high-risk region.\nUp until now, vehicles could easily access the lakeshore to pump water to fight fires, and aircraft could dip their buckets into the lake, according to Francis Gill, a Copco Lake resident and fire chief for the community's volunteer fire department. Gill fears that the community will be much more exposed to fire without the lake as a buffer.\n\"Now, instead of having that lake as a huge barrier, we get the potential for fire to jump the river, get from one side to the other easily,\" Gill said. \"Especially just with the way the wildfires have been getting the last 10 years. They just blow up so fast and get so big, so quickly.\"\nOther large dam removals on the Penobscot River in Maine and on the Elwha River in Washington state have shown that rivers — and the fish that depend on them — can recover quickly. The successful campaign and restoration of the Klamath watershed will no doubt inform other dam removal efforts.\n\"Every time we do this, and we do this at a big scale, we learn new things about the legal pathways,\" said Dave Owen, a law professor at the University of California, San Francisco. \"It just helps people see that this is possible, and that it can be highly successful.\"\nAdvocates and analysts are eyeing four dams on the Lower Snake River in Washington as the next big dam removal in the queue. Owen says that who owns the dams and what the dams are used for greatly impacts the politics around their removal.\n\"Along the Snake River, you have irrigators who rely on some of those reservoirs; you also have barge traffic, that's conveying wheat,\" Owen said. These factors make the Snake River dams a \"harder case.\" Still, the removal of the Klamath River dams \"makes action on the Snake River more likely than it was a few years ago,\" he said.\nFor the next week, water will flow through the bypass tunnel at an average rate of 2,200 cubic feet per second, draining down Iron Gate reservoir between two and four feet per day. Later this month, J.C. Boyle, the uppermost of the three dams, will be breached, followed by Copco 1. By June, the Klamath River should be flowing more or less within its historic channel, and the work of dismantling the structures can begin.\nAdvocates are quick to point out that dam removal alone will not save the Klamath River's salmon runs. However, removing the barriers will open up 76 miles of coho habitat and over 400 miles of Chinook habitat, says Shari Witmore, a fish biologist at NOAA Fisheries.\nIf modeling is correct, as many as 80% more Chinook salmon could return to the basin within about 30 years after the dams are removed. Ocean harvest could increase by as much as 46%. But this will depend in part on restoring important tributaries, including the cold spring-fed rivers in the upper Klamath Basin, which have been compromised with diking and draining of wetlands.\n\"Once we restore that, we put this basin back together,\" Witmore says. \"That creates a lot of resilience over time with climate change, and it buffers against multi-year droughts.\"\nCordalis, the Yurok Tribe member, agrees that more work lies ahead. But she's also looking forward to fulfilling a simple personal goal.\n\"Fishing,\" she said. \"I want to go fishing.\"\nCorrection Jan. 14, 2024\nAn earlier version of this story said the four dams on the Lower Snake River are in Idaho. They are in fact in Washington state.","extracted_keywords":["removal","dams","dam","salmon","water","years","fish","people","river","time"]}

It was about four inches long, which was \"bigger than any piece of bone I'd ever found before,\" says Justin. \"So I was very excited and sat down to have a good look at it.\"\nMeanwhile, Ruby kept walking along the beach, eyes scanning the ground. She soon found a second piece of bone half buried in a mud slope that was twice as long as the first — and much better preserved. \"It was just sort of lying there,\" recalls Ruby. \"I was just happy, really.\"\nRuby and her father would later discover that they'd just chanced upon part of the largest marine reptile ever found — a giant ichthyosaur from 202 million years ago, near the end of the Triassic Period.\nThese animals were once the dominant predators of the world's oceans. Imagine a chunky shark with a long, toothy snout, fins, and four flippers.\n\"These are reptiles only very, very distantly related to things like crocodiles,\" says Dean Lomax, a paleontologist at the University of Bristol and the University of Manchester. And they actually resemble whales, which are mammals, in key ways: \"They gave birth to live young. They committed entirely to a life at sea — they didn't come onto land.\"\nIn research published in PLOS ONE, Lomax, Ruby and Justin Reynolds, and their colleagues describe this new species of ichthyosaur, Ichthyotitan severnensis, as roughly 82 feet long. That's twice the length of a school bus.\n\"There were things that we can't even possibly imagine in the past,\" says Kelsey Stilson, a biomechanist at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris who wasn't involved in the research. \"But we can get little hints. And this is one little hint at this larger picture\" of how life evolved on Earth.\nA prehistoric puzzle\nThe discovery of Ichthyotitan severnensis actually began almost eight years ago. Paul de la Salle, an avid amateur fossil collector, was combing a beach in Lilstock in Somerset when he came upon multiple chunks of fossilized bone. He showed them to Lomax, a longtime friend of his.\n\"They fit together perfectly like an ancient prehistoric jigsaw puzzle,\" says Lomax. \"And we could work out that it belongs to a jawbone of a reptile called an ichthyosaur that swam in the seas at the time of the dinosaurs.\"\nBut the thing that struck Lomax was that this bone, called a surangular, was big — over three feet long. \"It suggests that it was from something unusual, and something exceedingly large,\" he says.\nLomax, de la Salle, and their colleagues published a description of the specimen, but the bone was incomplete and partly eroded, so they had to kind of leave it at that — as tantalizing as it was to imagine what this animal may have looked like.\n\"What we'd hoped for — we kept our fingers crossed — we hoped that maybe more specimens would come to light in the future,\" says Lomax.\nA couple years passed. Then, in May 2020, Lomax received an email from Ruby and Justin Reynolds who'd just concluded their trip to Blue Anchor, their two fossil treasures in hand. He recalls that the message said something to the effect of, \"Hey, Dr. Lomax — we think we've found another one of your giant ichthyosaur jawbones.\"\nLomax downloaded the images. \"Of course, they were quite right,\" he says. \"They correctly identified these sections of bone as belonging to an ichthyosaur.\" Lomax was encouraged by how well preserved the Reynolds' fossils were. He organized subsequent collection trips to the beach in Somerset, which yielded additional fragments of the same jawbone.\nThis second specimen was nearly twice as complete as the first. Lomax and his colleagues were now confident that this was a new species, which they named Ichthyotitan severnensis after the Severn Estuary in Somerset where it was found. He cautions that without a full skeleton, he can't be sure of the size. The animal could have had a giant head and a more compact body. But if it was built like other ichthyosaurs, Lomax says it would have been massive.\n\"Genuinely enormous, about the length of a blue whale,\" he says.\nThis makes it the largest ichthyosaur — and therefore the largest marine reptile — ever described. In fact, Lomax says the animal may not have even been fully grown when it died.\nThe end of an era\nThe Triassic Period was, in Kelsey Stilson's words, \"a really weird time.\"\n\"That's when you see the first very early mammals and the first very early dinosaurs,\" they say. \"Everything's starting right then.\"\nThe end of the Triassic was when Ichthyotitan severnensis reigned, at a moment right before a mass extinction event that swallowed up these animals forever.\n\"No marine reptile ever reached such gigantic sizes ever again,\" says Lomax.\nNot all ichthyosaurs vanished, though the ones that survived and evolved during the Jurassic and Cretaceous Periods were smaller. But they too went extinct around 94 million years ago, which created an opening in the ocean.\nIt was \"a niche to be filled,\" says Lomax, \"which is where eventually you had mammals — including the first whales that were walking around on land — [make] that transition into the ocean.\"\nWith the top perch in the food web now vacated, whales took over as the dominant marine predators.\nAnd underwater reptilian rule was over.","extracted_keywords":["bone","reptile","beach","ichthyosaur","years","severnensis","piece","end","whales","mammals"]}

But in these tests, the insects couldn't count very high — only to about four.\nStill, that made a team of researchers in Australia and France want to explore what else the bees could do with numbers. Scarlett Howard at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia, lured bees to a wall where they were presented with two square cards. Each card had a different number of black symbols, such as dots or triangles.\nHoward trained one group of bees to understand that sugar water would always be located under the card with the least number of symbols. \"They could come and see two circles versus three circles, or four triangles versus one triangle, or something like that,\" she explains.\nThe bees quickly learned to fly to the card with the fewest symbols, an impressive feat.\nBut then they got another test: The researchers presented the bees with a card that had a single symbol — and a blank card that had nothing on it.\nThe bees seemed to understand that \"zero\" was less than one, because they flew toward the blank card more often than you'd expect if they were choosing at random — although they weren't that good at distinguishing between the two.\nIt got easier for them when they had to compare zero with a larger number. \"When we showed them zero versus six, they did that at a much higher level than zero versus one,\" Howard says. \"So what tells us is that they consider zero as an actual quantity along the number line. They're actually better at doing zero versus six because those two numbers are further apart.\"\n\"We were very surprised and happy, excited, to see that actually the bees were choosing the empty paper,\" says Aurore Avargues-Weber, a CNRS researcher with the University of Toulouse.\nEven very young children, she points out, have trouble understanding that zero is a number. \"It's easy for them to count 'one, two, three, four,' but zero, it's nothing, it's not something to count.

Climate, Deforestation Threaten Monarch Migration\n2020 was a bad year for butterflies, too.\nThe population of monarch butterflies that migrated to Mexico to ride out the cold winter months in the north fell 26% from a year earlier, according to a new report from the Mexican government and the Word Wildlife Fund.\nMexico's Commission for Natural Protected Areas said the butterflies' population occupied only 2.10 hectares in 2020, compared to 2.8 hectares a year earlier. And the monarch Biosphere Reserve in Michoacán, Mexico lost trees at a higher rate than it did in 2019.\nA combination of logging, falling trees, and drought in the areas where the butterflies roost, as well as a reduction of milkweed in their breeding places, pose threats to the monarch's migration. But the damage wrought by climate change is the biggest factor.\nDuring the spring and summer of 2020, wild weather in the southern United States killed milkweed blossoms--which female monarch butterflies lay their eggs upon. In turn, the development of butterfly eggs and larvae was also impacted, the report said.\nDespite the report's findings, the butterfly isn't in danger of extinction, said Jorge Rickards, director general of WWF-Mexico.\nHowever, the monarch's migratory process is at risk, he said, and the governments, the scientific community, and civil society of Mexico, the U.S. and Canada must work together to ensure the survival of the butterfly going forward.\nRickards said, \"Monarch butterflies show us how individual work, in this case, migration, can become an exceptional collaborative exercise, when all these migrants gather in the forests to hibernate together and buffer the climate.\"\nThe number of the black and orange butterflies wintering in Mexico has been decreasing for several years, according to research by the World Wildlife Fund. The organization previously said in 2013 the number of butterflies wintering there was at its lowest in the prior 20 years up until that point.\nColder, wetter winters can be lethal for monarchs while hotter, drier summers alter their habitats in the north.\nThe monarch is the only butterfly known to make a two-way migration like birds do, according to U.S. Forest Service. Monarchs can't survive the cold winters of northern climates, unlike other butterflies.\nMonarchs can travel between 50-100 miles a day. It can take the insects up to two months to complete their journey to their winter sojourn.","extracted_keywords":["butterflies","monarch","butterfly","year","report","migration","population","winter","months","north"]}

For two decades, the archive has collected and digitized more than 60,000 gospel songs, creating a searchable online database of previously unattainable records. The project's next challenge is to hunt down rare and hard-to-find songs and oral histories, and it's received a $2.4 million grant to do that. KWBU's Molly-Jo Tilton reports from Waco, Texas.\nMOLLY-JO TILTON: Tucked in the corner of Baylor University's Memorial Library, the Black Gospel Archive's walls are packed from top to bottom with records, cassettes and sheet music reflecting decades of music history.\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"HE NEVER HAS LEFT ME ALONE\")\nTHE ANGELIC GOSPEL SINGERS: (Singing) Since I gave to Jesus my poor broken heart, he never has left me alone.\nTILTON: The archive houses and digitizes the gospel records that are most vulnerable, those recorded in the golden era of gospel. This is roughly 1945 to 1980. And once those records disappear, they'll be gone forever - songs like \"The Old Ship Of Zion,\" performed by the choir The Mighty Wonders Of Aquasco, Maryland. The original records were sold at church performances, but now only two copies are known to remain.\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"THE OLD SHIP OF ZION\")\nTHE MIGHTY WONDERS OF AQUASCO, MARYLAND: (Singing) Step on board if you want to see Jesus. Just step on board, and follow me.\nTILTON: Anyone with an internet connection can listen to these songs. The archive also holds important artifacts, like recorded preachings, concert announcements, sheet music and blog posts, aiming to preserve the history of Black gospel culture as well. Gospel historian Robert Darden said this is part of what inspired the creation of the archive nearly two decades ago.\nROBERT DARDEN: It is the music that endured, and now it continues to be one of the greatest legacies and the greatest records we have of a period in American life as shameful as it was.\nTILTON: At a time when Black Americans were protesting segregation and discrimination, gospel boomed as a form of protest, often sung both to boost spirits and in defiance.\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"WE SHALL OVERCOME\")\nALICE MCCLARTY AND THE TRAVELING ECHOES: (Singing) We shall overcome.\nTILTON: Songs like \"We Shall Overcome\" became anthems for the civil rights protesters.\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"WE SHALL OVERCOME\")\nALICE MCCLARTY AND THE TRAVELING ECHOES: (Singing) We shall overcome.

It's going to allow me to go to them and interview them and ask them questions about their church history and about gospel music artists.\nTILTON: That's Stephen Newby, the archive's ambassador. He says oral histories are some of the most important elements the archive is missing.\nNEWBY: I see gaps in the story, and this grant is going to allow me to take some time and attempt to fill some of those gaps.\nTILTON: Newby says that there's no way to know how many uncatalogued gospel records remain, but the team will keep digitizing them as long as people keep sending them.

So they took me to the emergency room to get me checked out,\" Gray says. \"That's when they found out that I was having my first crisis.\"\nIt was Gray's first sickle cell crisis. These episodes are one of the worst things about sickle cell disease, a common and often devastating genetic blood disorder. People with the condition regularly suffer sudden, excruciating bouts of pain.\n\"Sometimes it feels like lightning strikes in my chest — and real sharp pains all over. And it's a deep pain. I can't touch it and make it better,\" says Gray. \"Sometimes, I will be just balled up and crying, not able to do anything for myself.\nGray is now 34 and lives in Forest, Miss. She volunteered to become the first patient in the United States with a genetic disease to get treated with the revolutionary gene-editing technique known as CRISPR.\nNPR got exclusive access to chronicle Gray's journey through this medical experiment, which is being watched closely for some of the first hints that changing a person's genes with CRISPR could provide a powerful new way to treat many diseases.\n\"This is both enormously exciting for sickle cell disease and for all those other conditions that are next in line,\" says Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health.\n\"To be able to take this new technology and give people a chance for a new life is a dream come true,\" Collins says. \"And here we are.\"\nDoctors removed bone marrow cells from Gray's body, edited a gene inside them with CRISPR and infused the modified cells back into her system this summer. And it appears the cells are doing what scientists hoped — producing a protein that could alleviate the worst complications of sickle cell.\n\"We are very, very excited,\" says Dr. Haydar Frangoul of the Sarah Cannon Research Institute in Nashville, Tenn., who is treating Gray.\nFrangoul and others stress that it's far too soon to reach any definitive conclusions. Gray — and many other patients — will have to be treated and followed for much longer to know whether the gene-edited cells are helping.\n\"We have to be cautious. It's too early to celebrate,\" Frangoul says. \"But we are very encouraged so far.\"\nCollins agrees.\n\"That first person is an absolute groundbreaker. She's out on the frontier,\" Collins says. \"Victoria deserves a lot of credit for her courage in being that person. All of us are watching with great anticipation.\"\nThis is the story of Gray's journey through the landmark attempt to use the most sophisticated genetic technology in what could be the dawn of a new era in medicine.\nLife filled with pain\nWhen I first meet her, Gray is in a bed at the TriStar Centennial Medical Center in Nashville wearing a hospital gown, big gold hoop hearings and her signature glittery eye shadow.\nIt's July 22, 2019, and Gray has been in the hospital for almost two months. She is still recovering from the procedure, parts of which were grueling.\nNevertheless, Gray sits up as visitors enter her room.\n\"Nice to meet y'all,\" she says.\nGray is just days away from her birthday, which she'll be celebrating far from her husband, her four children and the rest of her family. Only her father is with her in Nashville.\n\"It's the right time to get healed,\" says Gray.\nGray describes what life has been like with sickle cell, which afflicts millions of people around the world, including about 100,000 in the United States. Many are African American.\n\"It's horrible,\" Gray says. \"When you can't walk or, you know, lift up a spoon to feed yourself, it gets real hard.\"\nThe disease is caused by a genetic defect that turns healthy, plump and pliable red blood cells into deformed, sickle-shaped cells. The defective cells don't carry oxygen well, are hard and sticky and tend to clog up the bloodstream. The blockages and lack of oxygen wreak havoc in the body, damaging vital organs and other parts of the body.\nGrowing up, Victoria never got to play like other kids. Her sickle cells made her weak and prone to infections. She spent a lot of time in the hospital, recovering, getting blood transfusions — all the while trying to keep up with school.\n\"I didn't feel normal. I couldn't do the regular things that every other kid could do. So I had to be labeled as the sick one.\"\nGray made it to college. But she eventually had to drop out and give up her dream of becoming a nurse. She got a job selling makeup instead but had to quit that too.\nThe sickle-shaped cells eventually damaged Gray's heart and other parts of her body. Gray knows that many patients with sickle cell don't live beyond middle age.\n\"It's horrible — knowing that I could have a stroke or a heart attack at any time because I have these cells in me that are misshapen,\" she says. \"Who wouldn't worry?\"\nGray married and had children. But she hasn't been able to do a lot of things most parents can, like jump on a trampoline or take her kids to sporting events. She has often had to leave them in the middle of the night to rush to the hospital for help.\n\"It's scary. And it affected my oldest son, you know, because he's older. So he understands. He started acting out in school. And his teacher told me, 'I believe Jemarius is acting out because he really believes you're going to die,' \" Gray says, choking back tears.\nSome patients can get help from drugs, and some undergo bone marrow transplants. But that procedure is risky; there's no cure for most patients.\n\"It was just my religion that kind of kept me going,\" Gray says.\nAn eager volunteer\nGray had been exploring the possibility of getting a bone marrow transplant when Frangoul told her about a plan to study gene editing with CRISPR to try to treat sickle cell for the first time. She jumped at the chance to volunteer.\n\"I was excited,\" Gray says.\nCRISPR enables scientists to edit genes much more easily than ever before. Doctors hope it will give them a powerful new way to fight cancer, AIDS, heart disease and a long list of genetic afflictions.\n\"CRISPR technology has a lot of potential use in the future,\" Frangoul says.\nTo try to treat Gray's sickle cell, doctors started by removing bone marrow cells from her blood last spring.\nNext, scientists used CRISPR to edit a gene in the cells to turn on the production of fetal hemoglobin. It's a protein that fetuses make in the womb to get oxygen from their mothers' blood.\n\"Once a baby is born, a switch will flip on. It's a gene that tells the ... bone marrow cells that produce red cells to stop making fetal hemoglobin,\" says Frangoul, medical director of pediatric hematology/oncology at HCA Healthcare's TriStar Centennial Medical Center.\nThe hope is that restoring production of fetal hemoglobin will compensate for the defective adult-hemoglobin sickle cells that patients produce.\n\"We are trying to introduce enough ... fetal hemoglobin into the red blood cell to make the red blood cell go back to being happy and squishy and not sticky and hard, so it can go deliver oxygen where it's supposed to,\" Frangoul says.\nThen on July 2, after extracting Gray's cells and sending them to a lab to get edited, Frangoul infused more than 2 billion of the edited cells into her body.\n\"They had the cells in a big syringe. And when it went in, my heart rate shot up real high. And it kind of made it hard to breath,\" Gray says. \"So that was a little scary, tough moment for me.\"\nAfter that moment passed, Gray says, she cried. But her tears were \"happy tears,\" she adds.\n\"It was amazing and just kind of overwhelming,\" she says, \"after all that I had went through, to finally get what I came for.\"\nThe cells won't cure sickle cell. But the hope is that the fetal hemoglobin will prevent many of the disease's complications.\n\"This opens the door for many patients to potentially be treated and to have their disease modified to become mild,\" Frangoul says.\nThe procedure was not easy. It involved going through many of the same steps as a standard bone marrow transplant, including getting chemotherapy to make room in the bone marrow for the gene-edited cells. The chemotherapy left Gray weak and struggling with complications, including painful mouth sores that made it difficult to eat and drink.\nBut Gray says the ordeal will have been worth it if the treatment works.\nShe calls her new gene-edited cells her \"supercells.\"\n\"They gotta be super to do great things in my body and to help me be better and help me have more time with my kids and my family,\" she says.\nConcerns about risk\nOther doctors and scientists are excited about the research. But they're cautious too.\n\"This is an exciting moment in medicine,\" says Laurie Zoloth, a bioethicist at the University of Chicago. \"Everyone agrees with that. CRISPR promises the capacity to alter the human genome and to begin to directly address genetic diseases.\"\nStill, Zoloth worries that the latest wave of genetic studies, including the CRISPR sickle cell study, may not have gotten enough scrutiny by objective experts.\n\"This a brand-new technology. It seems to work really well in animals and really well in culture dishes,\" she says. \"It's completely unknown how it works in actual human beings. So there are a lot of unknowns. It might make you sicker.\"\nZoloth is especially concerned because the research involves African Americans, who have been mistreated in past medical studies.\nFrangoul acknowledges that there are risks with experimental treatments. But he says the research is going very slowly with close oversight by the Food and Drug Administration and others.\n\"We are very cautious about how we do this trial in a very systematic way to monitor the patients carefully for any complications related to the therapy,\" Frangoul says.\nGray says she understands the risks of being the first patient and that the study could be just a first step that benefits only other patients, years from now. But she can't help but hope it works for her.\nShe imagines a day when she may \"wake up and not be in pain\" and \"be tired because I've done something — not just tired for no reason.\" Perhaps she could play more with her kids, she says, and look forward to watching them grow up.\n\"That means the world to me,\" Gray says.\nIt could be many weeks or even months before the first clues emerge about whether the edited cells are safe and might be working.\n\"This gives me hope if it gives me nothing else,\" she says in July.\nHeading home at last\nAbout two months later, Gray has recovered enough to leave the hospital. She has been living in a nearby apartment for several weeks.\nEnough time has passed since Gray received the cells for any concerns about immediate side effects from the cells to have largely passed. And her gene-edited cells have started working well enough for her immune system to have resumed functioning.\nSo Gray is packing. She will finally go home to see her children in Mississippi for the first time in months. Gray's husband is there to drive her home.\n\"I'm excited,\" she says. \"I know it's going to be emotional for me. I miss the hugs and the kisses and just everything.\"\nGray is wearing bright red glittery eye shadow. It matches her red tank top, which repeats \"I am important\" across the front.\nShe unzips a suitcase and starts pulling clothes from the closet.\n\"My goodness. Did I really bring all this?\" she says with a laugh.\nBefore Gray can finish packing and depart, she has to stop by the hospital again.\n\"Are you excited about seeing the kids?\" Frangoul says as he greets her. \"Are they going to have a big welcome sign for you in Mississippi?\"\nTurns out that Gray has decided to make her homecoming a surprise.\n\"I'm just going to show up tomorrow. Like, 'Mama's home,' \" she says, and laughs.\nAfter examining Gray, Frangoul tells her that she will need to come back to Nashville once a month for checkups and blood tests to see if her genetically modified cells are producing fetal hemoglobin and giving her healthier red blood cells.\n\"We are very hopeful that this will work for Victoria, but we don't know that yet,\" Frangoul says.\nGray will also keep detailed diaries about her health, including how much pain she's experiencing, how much pain medication she needs and whether she needs any blood transfusions.\n\"Victoria is a pioneer in this. And we are very excited. This is a big moment for Victoria and for this pivotal trial,\" Frangoul says. \"If we can show that this therapy is safe and effective, it can potentially change the lives of many patients.\"\nGray hopes so too.\n\"Not just for me, but for other people, this would be mind-blowing,\" Gray says. \"Oh my God. I can't imagine the lives that could be saved if this thing actually works.\"\nBefore she leaves, Gray has to let the nurses take a big blood sample for the study she is in. The trial is being conducted by CRISPR Therapeutics in Cambridge, Mass., and Vertex Pharmaceuticals in Boston. The project will eventually involve dozens of patients in the United States, Canada and Europe.\nAs the nurses fill one big vial after another, Gray talks about how she feels about having modified cells circulating in her body.\n\"I'm just genetically modified now,\" she says with a giggle. \"I'm a GMO. Isn't that what they call it?\"\nGray knows she's about to start a limbo period of waiting to find out if her edited cells are working.\n\"I'm spiritual. And it's something I prayed about,\" she says. \"And just the way everything happened for me, I just feel like it was fate for me to be here. So I just believe that God is doing this for me.\"\nThe big reveal\nIt's a foggy morning a few weeks later. Gray steps out of her car in a parking garage at the hospital. She just drove back to Nashville after spending about a month at home in Mississippi.\n\"I feel good,\" she says. \"I'm hoping to get some good news today.\"\nFrangoul should have some results from her latest blood tests about whether her genetically modified cells are working.\nGray says she's not nervous, except \"about the needles.\" She will have to go through another big blood draw today.\nFor this visit, Gray is wearing a black sweatshirt with big letters that spell out \"Warrior.\"\n\"They call sickle cell patients warriors, and I saw this shirt at Walmart so I had to get it,\" she says as she heads over to give her blood sample.\nAs the nurses fill one big tube after another, Gray describes her homecoming a few weeks earlier.\n\"It was emotional for me, because I love them so much,\" she says, stifling tears. \"I did this for them. So it's worth it.\"\nThe nurses are finally done. Gray heads over to see her doctor.\n\"I'm terribly excited about your bloodwork today,\" Frangoul says.\nAfter a quick physical exam, Frangoul shows Gray what she'd been waiting for: The results of some of her blood tests.\n\"So look at this,\" says Frangoul, smiling, as he hands her a sheet of paper. \"This is very exciting. I am super-excited about your results today.\"\nGray's CRISPR-edited cells seem to be working.\n\"It looks like there are signs that you are starting to make fetal hemoglobin, which is very exciting for us,\" Frangoul says.\nNearly half the hemoglobin in Gray's blood is now fetal hemoglobin, which is more than doctors think is needed to help alleviate the complications of sickle cell. And the level of that protein seems to be continuing to rise.\n\"Oh my goodness,\" Gray says.\nThe treatment also still seems safe, so far. There have been no signs of any ill effects from the modified cells.\nIn addition, there are clues that the cells could already be helping Gray. She hasn't needed any blood transfusions since she got the cells, hasn't had any pain attacks and hasn't had to rush to the hospital for help.\n\"That's good. Excellent. Perfect,\" Frangoul says. \"This is extremely encouraging.\"\nTypically, Gray says, she would have had another pain episode by now.\n\"I would have had at least had something,\" she says.\n\"It's special, especially coming up on the holidays — because sometimes I would be in the hospital on Christmas,\" Gray says. \"So I'm looking forward to a whole new life for all of us.\"\nOther hopeful signs\nThe same kind of CRISPR gene-edited cells seem to be helping a patient who received them in Germany for a related genetic blood disorder called beta thalassemia.\nBut Frangoul knows he still must remain cautious.\n\"It is still too early to celebrate. I just want to make sure this is something we watch very carefully every visit and see how things are going,\" he says.\nDoctors will have to follow Gray for years and study many additional patients to answer the most important questions: Are the cells really helping patients live healthier lives? Will they keep working? Will they keep working safely? And will the cells actually help patients live longer?\n\"This would be life-changing, not only for Victoria but for many sickle cell patients,\" Frangoul says. \"Because if this is determined to be safe and effective, I think it can be transformative for patients with sickle cell disease.\"\nOther genetic therapies are also showing promise for sickle cell. So researchers have already started to try to make such expensive, complicated treatments practical and affordable, especially in poor countries. That's where diseases such as sickle cell are most common.\n\"The progress that we've seen for sickle cell disease, including Victoria Gray and her involvement in this, made it clear that if this is starting to work, we need to get busy and figure out how to take it to the next level,\" says Collins, the NIH director.\nZoloth, the University of Chicago bioethicist, says she's encouraged to see progress for a disease that has long been neglected. But she's still cautious about the research, especially because only one patient has been treated, and so recently. She worries about raising false hope.\n\"So far so good,\" Zoloth says. \"And of course that's great news. I hope it works. I hope she's free of this disease, and I hope this very, very brave woman has a life of joy and freedom from pain and can raise those beautiful children.\"\nBut, she adds, \"it's still very early days. We're still waiting for real news — which is, 'This is the definitive cure. This will help many, many thousands of people.' It would be a wonderful thing for humanity.\"\nOther doctors are using CRISPR to try to treat cancer. One team soon plans to try to edit genes inside the body for the first time — modifying genes in retinal cells of the eye to try to restore vision to people blinded by a rare genetic disorder.\nGray knows this is just the beginning. But she's happy things are going well so far.\n\"It's amazing to have a chance at a different type of life,\" Gray says. \"It's a miracle. When you pray and ask God for something for so long, all you have left is hope.\"\nGray has already started doing things she could never do before, such as go to one of her son's football games for the first time.\n\"I don't really want anything extravagant,\" she says. \"I just want a simple life with my family and the people who I love and people that love me — and just live, you know?\" Gray says. \"This could be the beginning of something special.\"\nThis story was produced by Jane Greenhalgh","extracted_keywords":["cells","cell","blood","patients","disease","gene","hemoglobin","pain","hospital","time"]}

It costs $2.125 million per patient.\nBut for those patients lucky enough to get it, it appears it can save their lives with a one-time treatment.\nThree-year-old Donovan Weisgarber is one of those patients. When he was born he seemed perfectly healthy. But within weeks, it became clear something was terribly wrong.\n\"It was about when he was about one month old that when we started to notice some symptoms,\" says his mother, Laura Weisgarber, 32, of Columbus, Ohio.\nDonovan started getting really fussy, stopped squirming, and got weaker and weaker.\nDonovan had spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a rare disorder caused by a defective gene; the illness destroys the nerves that control muscles. Babies with the most severe form of the disorder typically don't live past their second birthday.\n\"We were devastated,\" Weisgarber says, recalling the diagnosis. \"It was definitely the worst time of our lives.\"\nBut then doctors told Laura and her husband, Matthew, about an experimental gene therapy that was being tested for SMA. So they agreed to let them infuse Donovan with genetically modified viruses carrying healthy copies of the gene he needed.\nDonovan slowly started to improve. Donovan still needs a wheelchair to get around and a feeding tube for nutrition. But otherwise he's doing well, his mother says.\n\"He loves going outside. He loves playing with his family. He goes to preschool,\" Weisgarber says. \"He gets to do a lot of normal things. It's amazing.\"\nAnd Donovan isn't alone. The gene therapy — called Zolgensma — has been saving other babies with spinal muscular atrophy.\n\"We saw just remarkable results for these kids,\" says David Lennon, president of AveXis,Inc., of Bannockburn, Ill., the company that developed Zolgensma. The company is owned by drug giant Novartis. (AveXis connected NPR with the Weisgarber family.)\nBased on the AveXis studies, the FDA approved Zolgensma Friday, making it only the second gene therapy ever approved for a genetic disorder. There are currently around 700 patients eligible for the treatment, according to Novartis, and roughly 30 babies are born each month with the disease.\nNovartis set the price at $2.125 million but offers insurers the ability to pay $425,000 a year for five years. This price tag makes Zolgensma the most expensive drug ever approved.\n\"It's absolutely stunning,\" says Peter Bach, who studies health policy at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York.\nZolgensma's price tag, he says, is just the most extreme example of how drug prices are draining resources from society. The first gene therapy for an inherited disease was approved in 2017 for a genetic form of blindness. It is also very expensive — $425,000 for each eye.\n\"We have been slowly subjected to price increases the same way the frog in the boiling water is slowly boiled to death,\" Bach says.\nInsurers are expected to cover the cost. The company says payment plans will be available.\nAveXis president Lennon acknowledges the numbers might seem shocking. But he argues the drug is easily worth it. The only existing treatment for spinal muscular atrophy, a drug called Spinraza, costs hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. Zolgensma hopefully will be a one-time, life-saving treatment.\n\"We're talking about a lifetime of benefit being condensed down into a one-time treatment,\" Lennon says. \"We're not used to thinking about this that way. We're used to a system of a chronic medication where we spread things out over years if not decades.\"\nThe drug is delivered as a single one-time dose to address the genetic root cause of the disorder, the company says, producing long-term effects.\nFrom that point of view, Lennon calls it \"highly cost-effective\" and a \"fair and reasonable price.\"\nDrug companies need to be able to recoup the costs of developing life-saving, cutting-edge treatments, he says, if they're going to be encouraged to find new breakthroughs.\n\"We're continuing to reinvest in new therapies beyond Zolgensma into the next wave of gene therapies that are going to hopefully offer cures for other diseases,\" Lennon says.\nAt one point, Novartis said publicly that the price of Zolgensma might be as high as $5 million.\n\"Insurers were going to cover Zolgensma no matter the price,\" says Dr. Steven D. Pearson, president of the nonprofit Institute for Clinical and Economic Review in Boston, an independent research group that studies drug pricing. \"It is a positive outcome for patients and the entire health system that Novartis instead chose to price Zolgensma at a level that more fairly aligns with the benefits for these children and their families.\"\nICER estimated that a reasonable price would be between $1.2 and $2.1 million per treatment, based on an estimate of years of quality life valued at $100,000 to $15o,000 per year.\nDonovan's parents didn't have to pay for the treatment because their son was part of a research study. But they think Zolgensma is worth the price.\n\"I understand that it can be shocking when you see a price tag on a treatment like this,\" Weisbarger says. \"But giving someone a life — someone that would have died in infancy or early childhood the opportunity to live into adulthood — I think that's a valuable investment.\"\nThe company says it has been manufacturing the drug since January and supplies of the drug will be released \"shortly,\" Lennon says.","extracted_keywords":["drug","price","gene","treatment","therapy","disorder","time","company","patients","year"]}

Salmon is essential to Yurok ceremonies, for food, and for income. But this fall, the number of Chinook swimming up the Klamath, in the Pacific Northwest, was the lowest on record, threatening the tribe's entire culture and way of life.\nErika Chavez and Jerome Nick Jr., cousins who work for the Yurok Tribal Fisheries Department, are patrolling the Klamath River in the far northwest corner of California. Nick perches in the front of the boat, with Chavez at the helm as they head to the mouth of the river. \"Just checking to see if there's any tribal members fishing,\" Chavez says. \"Then we're gonna head up to the bridge to see if anyone's there.\"\nToday, the cousins are also are volunteering to catch salmon for tribal elders — the only fishing allowed this year.\nChavez slows the boat so Nick can pull up a net they set a couple hours ago. The verdict?\n\"No fish,\" Nick says, shaking his head.\nThe cousins are alone on the water today. In a normal year during commercial fishing season, Nick says, \"practically this whole area is nets, all the way up to the bridge. You just see corks on the water, the river's so packed with nets.\"\nWithout people on the river fishing, the salmon have a chance to travel up river to spawn. \"At least that's my hope,\" Chavez says.\nUnlike a lot of Yurok, Nick didn't grow up fishing. He moved here six years ago to get away from family drama in Oregon. Now, when he's not working the overnight shift at WalMart, he's on the water. \"I work here with my cousin and she keeps me sane,\" he says. \"She's my rock.\"\nChavez grew up with her family camping right here for the summer. Her grandma would make fry bread, and she and her great-grandma would watch everyone fish. Chavez started fishing when she was nine. \"My partner was my auntie, she's the one that taught me, and our whole bottom of our boat was filled with fish. Everyone was catching plenty for their families. It was beautiful.\"\nFor the Yurok, a rich salmon harvest means covering the basics. \"It feeds our family,\" Chavez says. \"When commercial's here we use that money to buy our kids school clothes.\"\nChavez usually fishes for her grandma. \"I get her 10 to 15 fish every year, so it's in her freezer for the whole year,\" she says. This year, \"she'll have to deal with deer meat or elk meat or something.\"\nAbout five minutes away in the town of Klamath, thousands of Yurok tribal members and friends gather every August for the tribe's Salmon Festival. There's a parade, and a stick game that looks to my untrained eye like a cross between wrestling and field hockey.\nTrue to the festival's name, there's salmon cooked in the traditional Yurok way. Around the edge of a long, narrow fire pit, salmon skewered on redwood sticks form a kind of crown. Oscar Gensaw monitors the scene, wearing a T-shirt that reads: Fish Boss.\n\"When you first start cooking, you get those fat rings around the fish like a ring on a tree,\" Gensaw says. \"When the fat starts dripping out of each of those rings you know that side is done.\"\nGensaw grew up in Klamath and has three sons and a baby daughter. \"My main goal is to pass this onto my boys so one day I can be the ultimate fish boss, and be on the side when they cook,\" he says with a laugh. But he wants to teach them with salmon caught in the Klamath — not the fish he's cooking with today.\n\"These come from Alaska,\" he says. The tribe had to buy this salmon, for the first time in the history of the festival.\nThe tribe works with federal agencies every year to estimate the fall run and to decide how many salmon can be caught. So few Chinook were expected to return to spawn this year that commercial fishing was shut down to protect them. The Yurok were allowed to catch just over 600 salmon, in a tribe of 6,000.\nThose low numbers are the end result of drought, disease, and a long history of habitat destruction. The Yurok place much of the blame on upstream dams that have blocked salmon from ancient spawning grounds for over a century. After years of debate and struggle, four dams are set to be removed by 2020.\nIn the parade, Annelia Hillman commands the megaphone for the Klamath Justice Coalition, chanting, \"Undam the Klamath, bring the salmon home.\" She tell me that tribes along the Klamath have had to fight logging, gold mining, the dams, and now a proposed natural gas pipeline. \"If we're putting our water at risk like that, we're putting life on earth at risk,\" she says.\nHillman's a youth social worker, and she says, when the balance with the river is off, the Yurok feel the effects. \"When we can't be in our river, can't eat our fish, it kind of takes our purpose away. We have one of the highest suicide rates ... and I think that's directly correlated to our lack of salmon and our inability to continue our way of life,\" Hillman says.\nThe Yurok have fought for years to maintain their ties to the Klamath River and its salmon. In the 1960s, game wardens arrested many Yurok time and again for gillnet fishing on the river, a practice banned by the state. One young man, Raymond Mattz, challenged the arrests. His fight went to the U.S. Supreme Court, which reaffirmed the tribe's fishing rights.\nHis nephew, Paul Mattz Van Mechelen, runs Paul's Famous Smoked Salmon on Highway 101. Customers know he's open if there's smoke coming from the traditional fire pit in front. \"That's my Yurok Weber!\" he jokes.\nVan Mechelen opened the shop 16 years ago after his grandmother came to him in a dream. A steady stream of customers comes to sample and buy the wild Chinook salmon he prepares with flavors like garlic, lemon pepper and teriyaki. Usually, he gets his stock from the Klamath River.\n\"Not the last two years, though,\" he says. \"I had to go to the Columbia River,\" hundreds of miles away in Oregon, where he buys from native fishermen. Gas, and payment for fish, are big expenses for a business owner who usually fishes about 50 feet from his store.\nThe losses go deeper than just finances. \"I got a great niece — she's only 2 — but she helped start up the boat and and smiled and did all that last year,\" Van Mechelen says. \"Her auntie was five when she pulled in a fish. So that whole part of learning and teaching them who they are and what this river gives to them is kind of life in one way.\"\nWhen I ask him to explain that, that fishing is who Yurok are, Van Mechelen gets emotional, even stepping out of the store for a minute.\n\"I had my grandma at a young age tell me I had fish blood. I didn't understand it, I didn't know why. But we're all fishing people.\"\nAnd when you have fish blood but you have to stay away from fishing in hopes of keeping salmon here in the future? \"It's sad to stay next to a river and wake up and not see fish go by,\" Van Mechelen says. \"That's the saddest part. It's bad enough you dream about it.\"\nAll he can do, he says, is pray the salmon come back.\nThis piece is part of the series California Foodways and was produced in collaboration with the Food & Environment Reporting Network, a non-profit, investigative news organization.

But in reality, it's all one tree connected by a single root system.\nIn a sense, Pando \"redefines trees,\" says Lance Oditt, who directs the nonprofit Friends of Pando.\nWhat started as one seed now spans 80 football fields and weighs some 6,000 tons. \"They look like tree trunks to us, but stems is the proper scientific term,\" he says. \"They go 80 feet into the sky.\"\nOditt is always searching for better ways to get his head around a tree this enormous. And he started wondering: \"What would happen if we asked a sound conservationist to record the tree? What could a geologist, for example, learn from that, or a wildlife biologist?\"\nSo about a year ago, Oditt invited sound artist Jeff Rice to visit Pando and record the tree.\n\"I just dove in and started recording everything I could in any way that I could,\" says Rice, who made his pilgrimage to the mighty aspen last July.\nRice says that sound recordings aren't just works of art.\n\"They also are a record of the place in time, the species and the health of the environment,\" he says. \"You can use these recordings as a baseline as the environment changes.\"\nIn mid-summer, the aspen's leaves are pretty much at their largest. \"And there's just a really nice shimmering quality to Pando when you walk through it,\" says Rice. \"It's like a presence when the wind blows.\"\nThat's what Rice wanted to capture first — the sound of those bright lime green leaves fluttering in the wind.\nHe attached little contact microphones to individual leaves and was treated to this sound in return:\nPiezo Leaves\nThe leaves had \"this percussive quality,\" he says. \"And I knew that all of these vibrating leaves would create a significant amount of vibration within the tree.\"\nRice then set out to capture that tree-wide vibration in the midst of a thunderstorm. \"I was hunkered down and huddling, trying to stay out of the lightning. When those storms come through Pando, they're pretty big. They're pretty dramatic.\"\nAll that wind blowing through the innumerable leaves offered Rice a sonic opportunity to record the tree.\n\"We found this incredible opening in one of the [stems] that I've dubbed the Pando portal,\" he says.\nInto that portal, he lowered a mic until it was touching the massive tangle of roots below.\nThis was the result:\nPando Vibrations\n\"As soon as the wind would blow and the leaves would start to vibrate,\" Rice says, \"you would hear this amazing low rumble.\"\nThe vibrations, he says, were passing through Pando's branches and trunks into the ground.\n\"It's almost like the whole Earth is vibrating,\" says Rice. \"It just emphasizes the power of all of these trembling leaves, the connectedness, I think, of this as a single organism.\"\nHe also captured the bark:\nBark Sample\nAnd, finally, the landscape:\nAspens Bed\nRice and Oditt are presenting these recordings at this week's Acoustical Society of America meeting in Chicago.\n\"This is the song of this ecosystem, this tree,\" says Oditt. \"So now we know sound is another way we can understand the tree.\"\nIn fact, the recordings have given Oditt research ideas, like using sound to map Pando's labyrinth of roots. But above all, they're a sonic snapshot of this leviathan at this moment in time.\n\"We have to keep in mind,\" says Oditt, \"that it's been changing shape and form for like 9000 years. I call it the David Bowie problem. It's constantly reinventing itself!\"\nAnd now, we've managed to turn up the volume to hear Pando as the baritone soloist it's always been.","extracted_keywords":["tree","leaves","sound","recordings","wind","trees","aspen","trunks","way","time"]}

They can solve mazes and puzzles, use tools, and are masters of camouflage. These complex abilities are powered by their sophisticated and giant brains.\nNow, in the journal Cell, researchers report that octopuses are able to edit genetic information to quickly resculpt those brains when confronted with changes in their environment.\nThese findings cast new light on the incredible adaptability of these shape-shifting creatures and may help scientists design therapeutics for problematic mutations in our own bodies.\nOctopuses are considered one of the smartest invertebrate animals on the planet, with sophisticated brains and complex nervous systems. In other animals, such big brains typically need to be treated with care.\nJust think about your own fragile brain. It's encased in a skull, bathed in oxygen, and tuned to work at a relatively stable body temperature. \"We spend a ton of energy maintaining a constant temperature,\" says Josh Rosenthal, a neurobiologist at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Mass. \"And a lot of that is so that our nervous system can operate more efficiently.\"\nToo hot (with a fever) or too cold (with hypothermia) and our brains sputter and begin to fail — and that's just several degrees off the norm. So our bodies keep everything at a steady temperature.\nOctopuses don't have that luxury. Their brains require just as much safekeeping as ours, but they're in squishy bodies swimming in water whose temperature can fluctuate by some 20 degrees.\n\"It's difficult to maintain a complex nervous system in the face of changing temperature,\" says Rosenthal. \"And that presents challenges.\"\nTweaking genetic recipes on the fly\nOctopuses have overcome that challenge with a unique trick hidden inside their cells. It has to do with a molecule called RNA, which is used to help translate DNA into the proteins that make up our bodies. To use an analogy, let's say you want to make a loaf of bread and you walk into a library filled with cookbooks.\n\"That cookbook itself, it's already printed and I can't change the book,\" says Matthew Birk, a biologist at Saint Francis University. \"But what I can do is make a copy, take it home to my kitchen,\" and bake the bread there.\nHere, the cookbooks are the DNA, which is hard-coded and doesn't change, the bread is the protein your body wants to make, and the RNA is the copy of the recipe that explains how to do it. RNA doesn't tend to change all that much. It's just the messenger.\nBut what if you're missing an ingredient — like butter?\n\"If those are the instructions you have, you're kinda sunk,\" says Rosenthal. \"But if you know that oil would work just as well — if you could edit that recipe and put that in, then that gives you flexibility.\"\nIn the brains of most animals — from fish to birds to bees to people — only a few percent of the RNAs get edited. But inside the brains of octopuses and their relatives, it's happening on a massive scale, affecting more than 60%.\nThe researchers wondered if something in these animals' environment might be driving all this tweaking, like temperature. Birk decided to run an experiment with help from the California two-spot octopus, which, when scrunched up, is about the size of a football.\n\"They look very much like your typical octopus,\" says Birk, \"although it does have two iridescent blue spots to try and scare a predator away.\" He says they're mischievous and good at camouflaging. And their coastal habitat in southern California and northern Mexico swings between warm summers and cool winters.\nIn the lab, Birk placed half his octopuses in cooler water and half in warmer water. After a few weeks, he collected RNA from their brains.\n\"We found that there were over 20,000 different locations on various different proteins that were edited,\" says Birk, with more tweaking in the cooler conditions.\nThat is, in response to changing temperatures, the octopuses remodeled their brains, presumably to keep them functioning properly. The same thing was true in the wild, where Birk collected individuals in the summer and winter by flushing them from their underwater dens with squirts of vinegar.\nThe octopuses are capable of making these edits in less than a day. Compare that to DNA, which takes generations to change. RNA provides a more flexible alternative.\nTweaking RNAs — editing the temporary copies of the recipes — leads to alterations in the proteins that they instruct the cell to make. For octopuses, there's no single, preferred version of a protein. Rather, there are multiple versions of numerous proteins in the animal's brain, each one suited to a different scenario.\n\"This study shows for the first time that in the same organism, under different conditions, it expresses different proteins from the same gene,\" says Eli Eisenberg, a physicist at Tel Aviv University. \"And they have different functional behavior that is presumably suited to the external temperature.\"\nThe inner life of an octopus\nIt's still not clear how these changes might impact an octopus in its daily life.\n\"What would be nice to see in future is what types of behaviors are affected by these different types of changes — their reaction speeds, their ability to camouflage,\" says Robyn Crook, a neurobiologist at San Francisco State University who wasn't involved in the research.\nBecause the octopuses do more editing in cooler temperatures, Crook also points out the strategy may not help them in the face of a changing climate and warming oceans. Though these octopuses can operate across a range of temperatures, she says it may not be \"a viable mechanism for escaping environmental change as a result of human activity.\"\nDespite octopuses living such different lives than we do, their unique brains may one day prove useful to us.\n\"We're trying to figure out how to capture this ability to use it towards therapeutics,\" explains Birk, like pain reduction or repairing harmful mutations that cause disease.\nOctopuses, he says, have a lot to teach us.\n\"They are fascinating and interesting, not just on the outside, where we can all see,\" Birk says. \"But also on the inside.\"","extracted_keywords":["octopuses","brains","temperature","proteins","bodies","animals","octopus","changes","water","bread"]}

NPR's Eric Westervelt talks with Amir Aczel about the origins of our numbers and his book, Finding Zero.\nERIC WESTERVELT, HOST:\nSo think of all the numbers you've encountered today - the clock in your smartphone, maybe the date on your calendar, the numbers on that highway sign. And those are just the ones you can see. It's easy to take numbers for granted. They're the scaffolding that our economy, our technology, huge parts of our daily life, are built on. But there was a time when a zigzagging line didn't mean two and a vertical line didn't mean one and a circle didn't mean zero. Just how that system developed is a question that's fascinated Amir Aczel since his childhood. He's a math and science writer, and his new book is \"Finding Zero: A Mathematician's Odyssey To Uncover The Origins Of Numbers.\"\nAMIR ACZEL: To me, the invention or discovery of numbers is the greatest intellectual invention of the human mind. I have say invention or discovery because that's a huge problem in the philosophy of mathematics. Did we invent numbers, or do they exist regardless of us? But writing numbers is certainly an invention, and that invention is what has obsessed me all of my life.\nWESTERVELT: You also explore some of the faults, starts and dead-ends along the way to our current system of numbers, which are known as Hindu- Arabic numerals. Could you talk about some of the number systems that, I guess you could say, have gone extinct?\nACZEL: Right. The Maya had a very interesting number which they used in calendars. And there was a zero there, actually. That number system didn't go anywhere. And then of course, there's the Babylonian number, (unintelligible) numbers, and they did not really have a zero. Sometimes they'd leave a space. And the best example - and my favorite - is the Roman numerals. And if you want to try something interesting with the Roman numerals, try to create the multiplication table and you can see it's very complicated. So and, the reason is that the numbers don't cycle. They have to use, say, L for 50 and C for 100. So it's unique, while we can use the same sign, like two, in different places. Two with a zero after it is 20. Two alone is just two. You can create numbers using the cyclicity of the numerals. And that's something that no other number system that I know of has.\nWESTERVELT: Why is zero, specifically, so important?\nACZEL: Without a zero, you couldn't allow the numerals to cycle. You couldn't do this example that I gave, the two followed by zero stands for 20, creating that great economy where just nine signs plus a zero allow us to write any number that we want.\nWESTERVELT: What sparked your interest in finding the origin of zero? You take us on this quest around the world.\nACZEL: I first became interested in numbers - my father was a ship's captain for cruise ship in the Mediterranean, and one of the favorite ports was Monte Carlo. And what I saw there were these numerals, and they're very beautiful, on a roulette table in the fanciest casino in the world. These numerals just captured me, my attention and my fascination. And it sort of - that really led me to pursue a career in mathematics and statistics. And then I became very interested in where these numerals came from. Everybody says, oh, numbers come from India. And I wanted to know how they came from India, and then I became aware of the big controversy with British scholar G. R. Kaye.\nWESTERVELT: Who was convinced that the zero came from the West.\nACZEL: Exactly, and he was actually an expert on India, but he was biased. He writes in one of his papers, like, Indians think that their history started several million years ago and of course this is nonsense and the numerals don't come from India.\nAnd the person I follow in the book, Georges Coedes, a French scholar, tried to prove the opposite. And this particular style that I'm after throughout this book that I'm trying to find is that zero that he used to defeat Kaye and his followers.\nWESTERVELT: Your book is called \"Finding Zero,\" so this isn't really a spoiler. I mean, you traced the earliest-known written representation of zero to this crumbling 7th century tablet that you find in Cambodia, and its stacked amid ruins of other ancient artifacts. What was going through your mind?\nACZEL: It's the greatest euphoria in my life. And I have a feeling I'll never have a moment like that ever again. And I just looked at it. I couldn't dare touch it, as if it were fragile - which it wasn't, it's a piece of stone weighing several tons. Greatest moment in my life.\nWESTERVELT: Tell us its significance, what it said. Where was the zero, and what did the zero mean there in that writing?\nACZEL: Well, it says Chaka 605 began in the fifth day of the waning moon. So it's really an astronomical description of the beginning of a year and a calendar called Chaka. So luckily, they had the date there. So because the date has a zero, we have the first zero. And they had to write a zero. And what the rest of the tablet talks about is about slaves to be given to a king and sacks of white rice and several other things. So it's a list of gifts to a local king.\nWESTERVELT: Amir, we knew this tablet existed. I mean, why was it so important to find the physical object?\nACZEL: Well, often times you read when you do research about something that disappeared. And when something is gone, it's really far from being the same anymore. To me, it was important to recover this artifact with the earliest zero because I feel it's important to see it and continue to study it. And there's a monument to this great invention of the human mind, the ability to write something down that represents complete nothingness.\nWESTERVELT: Amir Aczel speaking with us from WGBH in Boston. His new book is called \"Finding Zero.\" Thanks so much for speaking with us.\nACZEL: Thank you very much. It was my pleasure.\nCopyright © 2015 NPR. All rights reserved.

Only humans, primates, dolphins and some birds get the concept of zero - or at least that's what scientists used to think. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports that another creature can do math with zero. And it's the honeybee.\nNELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: Honeybees are tiny but talented. They have to explore to find food, sometimes flying more than 2 miles, and then find their way back to the hive. Scientists have done experiments showing that the bees can keep track of landmarks by counting.\nSCARLETT HOWARD: Bees could count up to four landmarks to find a place to forage.\nGREENFIELDBOYCE: Scarlett Howard is a researcher at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia. She wanted to know what other numerical skills bees might have.\nHOWARD: And one of the big ones that jumped out at us was to see if they could learn some numerical rules and then apply that to zero.\nGREENFIELDBOYCE: Zero is special and weird. Preschool children struggle to wrap their minds around it. To see how bees would handle zero, Howard lured them to a wall where they were presented with two square cards. Each card had a different number of black symbols, such as circles or triangles.\nHOWARD: They could come and see two circles versus three circles or four triangles versus one triangle or something like that.\nGREENFIELDBOYCE: She trained bees to understand that sugar water would always be located under the card with the least number of symbols. She says the bees would hover in front of the cards, inspecting them.\nHOWARD: And it's quite amazing to watch such a small-brained animal do something so complex and actually look like it's trying to work out a problem.\nGREENFIELDBOYCE: After the bees had learned to go for the smaller number, Howard presented the bees with two cards. One card had one symbol on it. And the other card was completely blank. Howard watched to see what the bees would do.\nHOWARD: So I guess I was excited, but I wasn't holding my breath for any results like the one we got.\nGREENFIELDBOYCE: The bees seemed to understand that zero was less than one because they flew toward the blank card more often than you'd expect if they were choosing at random, although they weren't that good at distinguishing between the two. It got easier for them when they had to compare zero with a larger number.\nHOWARD: What that tells us is that they consider zero as an actual quantity along the number line. They're actually better at doing zero versus six because those two numbers are further apart.\nGREENFIELDBOYCE: Other experiments, described in the journal Science, offer additional evidence that bees get the basic idea of zero. And that surprised Andreas Nieder.\nANDREAS NIEDER: This is quite amazing in my view that bees can really do it.\nGREENFIELDBOYCE: He's a scientist at the University of Tubingen in Germany who studies how animals process the idea of nothing. He says zero is so quirky and strange, it's hard for humans.\nNIEDER: We take longer to process zero. And for some adults, it remains a mysterious number. For instance, when asked whether it's an odd or an even number, people struggle with this.\nGREENFIELDBOYCE: And yet bees somehow manage to have a primitive grasp of zero.

Scientists are also making progress using older DNA techniques to help people with this common, devastating blood disorder. NPR health correspondent Rob Stein is in our studios to talk about the latest news about experimental genetic treatments for sickle cell disease. Hi, Rob.\nROB STEIN, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel.\nMARTIN: So just start off by reminding us about the effects of sickle cell disease - who gets it, how common it is.\nSTEIN: Yeah, it's - Rachel, it's a really awful disease that affects the red blood cells. You know, these are the cells that carry oxygen in our body.\nMARTIN: Yeah.\nSTEIN: And a genetic defect causes these red blood cells to become defective sickle-shaped cells, and they're really bad at carrying oxygen. They get stuck inside blood vessels. They cause horrible attacks of pain, organ damage, heart attacks, strokes. It affects millions of people around the world, including about 100,000 in this country.\nMARTIN: So has there been any way to treat sickle cell?\nSTEIN: So in this country, sickle cell mostly affects African Americans, and many people say it's been a neglected disease in this country. Some people can get bone marrow transplants, but they're really expensive, and they're risky. And in this country, most sickle cell patients, they don't make it past middle age. That seems to finally have started to change. There are two new drugs that are helpful - were recently approved for sickle cell. But there's really still no cure for most sickle cell patients.\nMARTIN: But there are some encouraging possibilities on the horizon, right?\nSTEIN: Yeah. So, Rachel, as you know, we've been following one sickle cell patient named Victoria Gray closely this year. She's the first person in the United States to get treated for a genetic disorder with a revolutionary kind of genetic engineering called CRISPR.\nMARTIN: Right.\nSTEIN: Scientists infused billions of her own cells that have been genetically modified with CRISPR into her body this summer to try to help her, and just recently, doctors reported the first hints that it looks promising. Now, it's super early, so we're not even close to really knowing if it works. But so far, so good.\nMARTIN: Great. So there's other, similar research out there, too?\nSTEIN: Yeah. Yeah. So scientists have been working for years, really, to try to use what's called gene therapy to treat sickle cell disease. Now, gene therapy is the first strategy scientists developed to try to treat diseases at the genetic level. It usually involves using harmless viruses to ferry new genes or genetic information into the body. Gene therapy caused some disasters early on, but it's finally started to work, and several experimental gene therapies are showing promise for sickle cell disease now.\nMARTIN: Well, how so? I mean, what specifically can you tell us about that?\nSTEIN: Yeah. Yeah. So there's this big scientific meeting that's just wrapping up today in Florida, where scientists are reporting more encouraging results. Now, one approach involves giving sickle cell patients' cells a new gene to compensate for the defective one, to make their bodies produce a healthy version of a protein called hemoglobin, and that's what red blood cells need to carry oxygen in the body. Another strategy is sort of similar to the CRISPR gene-editing approach that Victoria got; it involves using gene therapy to make cells produce a different kind of hemoglobin called fetal hemoglobin to make up for that defective hemoglobin.\nMARTIN: OK. So this is working? I mean, what do we know about results?\nSTEIN: Yeah. Well, again, so far so good. Yeah. For example, there are doctors in - at Boston Children's Hospital trying gene therapy to make fetal hemoglobin, and they say it's looking good for the first handful of patients that they've treated so far.\nAnd a company called Bluebird Bio is even further along. They're reporting promising results from 17 patients who got the most advanced version of that approach. That uses gene therapy to add a new gene to make up for the defective hemoglobin gene. And it looks like it's working. It's producing healthy hemoglobin and healthy red blood cells, and it even looks like it might be alleviating suffering for sickle cell patients treated so far. Now, you know, with all this stuff, I have to say, there's a whole long way to go.\nMARTIN: Yeah.\nSTEIN: A lot more patients will have to be treated and followed for years to make sure that it's safe, to really know how well it works and how long it might keep working. But it looks like there's at least hope finally on the horizon for sickle cell patients. If it does work, the next big question is how to pay for it. These new therapies are coming with really hefty price tags.\nMARTIN: NPR health correspondent Rob Stein. Rob, thank you.\nSTEIN: Sure thing, Rachel.\nCopyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

It is providing hope for babies born with this rare but often fatal disorder. But as NPR health correspondent Rob Stein reports, at more than $2 million, the treatment is the most expensive drug ever approved.\nROB STEIN, BYLINE: When Donovan Weisgarber was born, he seemed perfectly healthy. But within weeks, his mom, Laura, says it became clear something was wrong - terribly wrong.\nLAURA WEISGARBER: It was when he was about 1 month old - was when we started to notice some symptoms.\nSTEIN: He started getting really fussy, stopped squirming and got weaker and weaker. Turns out Donovan had a genetic disorder, spinal muscular atrophy. It was destroying the nerves that control his muscles. Many babies don't live beyond their second birthday. It's the most common genetic cause of death among infants.\nWEISGARBER: We were devastated obviously. Yeah, you know, obviously you're devastated. It was definitely the worst time of our lives.\nSTEIN: But then doctors told Laura and her husband, Matthew, about something new. They might be able to replace the defective gene killing Donovan with a new type of gene therapy. So they agreed to let doctors infuse Donovan with genetically modified viruses carrying healthy genes into his body. Donovan slowly started to improve, and three years later, Donovan still needs a wheelchair and a feeding tube but otherwise is doing great, his mom says.\nWEISGARBER: You know, he loves going outside. He loves playing with his family. He goes to preschool. So yeah, he gets to do a lot of normal things. So it's just - I mean, it's amazing.\nSTEIN: And Donovan isn't alone. This gene therapy has been saving other babies with spinal muscular atrophy. David Lennon is the president of AveXis, the company that makes what's now called Zolgensma.\nDAVID LENNON: First of all, a hundred percent of the kids survived. And this is a population where 92% of the kids would expect to have died or be on permanent ventilation by the time they're 20 months old. But then we also saw additional things. A lot of these kids could swallow. Seventy-five percent of these kids were able to sit. And we actually had a few kids who were able to stand and walk independently.\nSTEIN: Based on these results, Lennon says the company is justified in setting the price at $2.125 million for each child, which would make it the most expensive drug ever approved. And that price tag is making a lot of jaws drop.\nPETER BACH: You know, it's absolutely stunning.\nSTEIN: Peter Bach studies health policy at Memorial Sloan Cancer Center in New York.\nBACH: It's just alarming that we have gotten to a point where, you know, any treatment that is a product of this collective scientific enterprise that has grown out of the Human Genome Project that was publicly funded has now been captured by a single drug company and is now going to turn around and charge potentially millions.\nSTEIN: Bach says it's just the most extreme example of how drug prices are draining resources from society.\nBACH: We have been slowly subjected to price increases the same way the frog in the boiling water, you know, is slowly boiled to death.\nSTEIN: Now, Lennon acknowledges the price might seem shocking. But he argues it's worth it. The only existing treatment for spinal muscular atrophy costs hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, and this will hopefully be a one-time, lifesaving treatment that will last a lifetime.\nLENNON: What we're talking about and we have to remember is we're talking about a lifetime of benefit being condensed down into a one-time treatment. We're not used to thinking about this that way. We're used to a system of chronic medication where we spread costs out over years, if not decades.\nSTEIN: Drug companies need to be able to recoup the costs of developing lifesaving, cutting-edge treatments, Lennon says, if they're going to be encouraged to find new breakthroughs. Donovan's parents didn't have to pay because their son was part of a research study, but they think the treatment is worth the price.\nWEISGARBER: Giving someone a life, someone that would have died in infancy or early childhood the opportunity to live into adulthood, I mean, I don't know. I think that's valuable. I think it's a valuable investment.\nSTEIN: Rob Stein, NPR News.\nCopyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

Nowadays, Polly might want a Zoom call.\nA recent study took 18 pet parrots and examined whether video calls could help them fulfill their social needs.\nParrots are incredibly socially complex creatures, and surpass 6- and 7-year-old children in puzzle tasks and memory skills, says Jennifer Cunha of Northeastern University, who co-authored the study.\n\"They have high mental needs that aren't always catered to very well in companion situations,\" she said.\nAnd pet birds of a feather shouldn't always flock together, according to another lead researcher, Ilyena Hirskyj-Douglas from the University of Glasgow.\n\"A very high percentage of them have diseases which can be transferred when in-person interaction takes place,\" Hirskyj-Douglas said.\nSo Hirskyj-Douglas and Cunha got together with lead author Rébecca Kleinberger, also of Northeastern University, to see if parrots in captivity could find companionship through video calls.\nThey taught them to ring a bell, after which a tablet would be presented. One or two images of fellow parrots would appear on a phone or tablet, and using their beaks or tongues, the parrots would choose.\nTo see how much the parrots actually wanted to spend time on video chats, researchers measured engagement and agency.\n\"So how frequently they rang the parrots when the system was available and then how quickly they use the system,\" Hirskyj-Douglas explained.\nThey were prepared to see negative reactions from the birds, like aggression. But instead, they say they saw a lot of social behaviors they would potentially see between birds that were together or in the wild.\n\"So mirroring behaviors where they might move in the same kind of way, dancing, singing together,\" Cunha said. \"They really seem to, as one owner said, come alive during the calls.\"\nKleinberger said while there was potential for connection between animals through the screen, there were also unknown risks of exposing the birds to a new technology, so they had to be careful in training the owners and monitoring the video chats closely. But the researchers did conclude that video calling technology could reproduce some of the social benefits of living in a flock, even between parrot species.\nAnd Cunha said some of the birds still ask to chat with their pals.\n\"Some of the birds continue to call each other. So I think that there's a lot of long-term potential for these kinds of relationships,\" she said.\nIn other words, maybe what Polly wants is a lasting friendship, even through a screen.","extracted_keywords":["parrots","video","birds","chats","study","calls","friendship","time","needs","tablet"]}

He marveled at the vast array of pinned bugs before stopping in front of a large picture of the butterfly family tree.\nA number of spots on that tree, he saw, were curiously blank.\n\"Just looking at it, realizing that scientists at these museums still don't know these basic things — I'll never forget that day,\" Kawahara says.\nThat moment sparked a lifelong passion in Kawahara to fill in those blanks and determine where these charismatic insects originated. Now, he's gotten a little closer to an answer. His latest research shows that butterflies probably first flapped their wings in present-day western North America or Central America.\n\"We were surprised,\" says Kawahara, now the curator of butterflies and moths at the University of Florida. Before this, \"people had thought that butterflies originated somewhere in Asia.\"\nThis shift probably took place some 100 million years ago when a rogue lineage of moths moved dayward. The findings, published in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution, shed light on the origins of this remarkable group of insects that now populate the globe with 19,000 different species.\nButterflies first evolved from moths when they began feeding on the nectar of new species of flowering plants usually available during the day. That shift allowed these insects to shed their earth tones in favor of the riot of colors they're known for today, which often act to attract mates or warn predators that they're poisonous.\nOrigins of a butterfly scientist\nThe new discovery about these insects' beginnings is as much an origin story of the world's butterflies as it is of Kawahara.\nWhen he was a boy, he and his dad, artist On Kawara, went looking for butterflies every weekend. One day when he was eight years old, Kawahara was standing beside his dad in a neighborhood in Tokyo.\n\"And this unusual brown butterfly lands near the road,\" recalls Kawahara. \"My dad said, 'Oh, it's a snout butterfly.' I was like, 'Oh my gosh. I've read about these things, but I've never caught one.' So my hands were trembling. I had my butterfly net in my hand. I ran up to it and I caught it.\"\nThat was the beginning of Kawahara's butterfly collection. \"I still have that specimen,\" he says. \"And the handwriting from when I was eight years old is on the label. It's a very important specimen for me.\"\nKawahara split his childhood between Tokyo and New York where, later that same year, his father took him on that fateful trip to the American Museum of Natural History.\n\"I remember walking through those amazing collections,\" he says, \"and seeing all these butterflies and moths in these drawers.\"\nThat family tree he spotted on the office door revealed the gaps in scientists' knowledge that even a wealth of gossamer-winged specimens had yet to fill.\nHe credits his dad for shaping his life and for inspiring him to turn his passion for these insects into a profession. In the intervening years, those questions of where butterflies first emerged, how they evolved, and how they spread across the world only grew in importance to him.\n\"There's a lot of butterflies right now that are threatened,\" Kawahara explains. \"And understanding how these butterflies are related to each other, it serves as a framework to help us conserve them.\"\nIt's also important for conserving the flowers and plants that rely on butterfly pollination, and the species of birds that depend on butterflies for food.\n\"When we lose our butterflies, we lose our birds,\" says Adriana Briscoe, an evolutionary biologist at the University of California, Irvine who wasn't involved in the study.\nA worldwide research effort\nTo piece together that butterfly family tree, Kawahara worked with close to 90 colleagues from six continents to collect DNA from all kinds of butterflies.\n\"I felt like I was a kid all over again,\" he says.\nHe traveled to the Amazon rainforest, the dry savannahs of Mozambique, and back to Tokyo. He climbed the Andes to look for rare species. He even nabbed a yellow sulfur butterfly the size of a silver dollar right outside his office in Gainesville, Florida.\nAll he and his team needed for the DNA analysis was a tiny portion of one of each butterfly's six legs. \"It's not harmful,\" says Kawahara. \"And oftentimes, we can release the butterfly and this butterfly's still okay.\"\nThe bulk of the butterflies the research team studied were pinned specimens in museum collections. The oldest one was from 1946, a brown butterfly fringed in white captured in South Africa.\nThey used four supercomputers to run the genetic analysis of the DNA they'd gathered from 92% of all butterfly groups. And after nearly a decade of work, Kawahara had the family tree that he had been longing for since he was a boy.\nThis result — combined with knowing where butterflies are found today, plus the age and location of a few rare butterfly fossils — helped him and his colleagues zero in on where butterflies began some hundred million years ago.\n\"We were able to tell that where the butterflies originated was likely North or Central America,\" he says. \"Conclusively, it's not Asia, it's not Africa, it's not Europe.\"\nWhen butterflies first evolved, they fed on legumes. They likely then fluttered their way to South America, dispersing in waves across Asia, Australia, India, Africa and finally, 30 million years ago, Europe. This radiation resulted in the kaleidoscope of butterfly species we know today.\n\"It's an extremely rich view of the movement of butterflies — some of the most beautiful organisms on the planet,\" says Briscoe. She adds that it'll be worth analyzing the few remaining groups of butterflies that didn't make it into this analysis. \"These missing groups,\" she says, \"might help pinpoint where exactly in the Americas butterflies originated.\"\nBriscoe says she has another reason for being excited about these findings.\n\"More than any other place in the world, butterflies were sacred to the ancient people of Mesoamerica,\" she says. \"They were thought to be the souls of ancestors.\"\nFor Kawahara, the ancestor who's front of mind is his father, of course. He told his dad about this project right as it was beginning in 2014. \"He told me, 'That's wonderful,'\" recalls Kawahara, \"and he wished me luck.\"\nThat was the last time the two men spoke. His dad died two days later.\nKawahara says that one way he remembers him is through his personal butterfly collection, which now has 20,000 specimens. \"It's kind of like your diary,\" he says. \"It's really touching.\"\nEach butterfly is a memory for Kawahara — a moment in time where he can stand beside his dad once again.","extracted_keywords":["butterflies","butterfly","years","dad","moths","tree","insects","species","family","day"]}

It's our top indoor pest, a species that keeps managing to adapt to our attempts to eradicate them.\nCoby Schal, an entomologist at North Carolina State University, is very familiar with these insects — and with the trappings of roach romance.\nIn his lab, he deposits a female German cockroach in a dish. After a few minutes, he adds another roach.\n\"There we go, I just introduced a male,\" he says. Each insect is the size of a lima bean.\nA pheromone wafts off female roaches like this one like an intoxicating perfume, which lures males in. It seems to be working here. \"See, he's starting to follow the female,\" Schal observes.\nOnce the two make contact, he raises his wings. This exposes a gland on his back, from which he secretes a \"nuptial gift\" — a sweet chemical slurry that the female consumes. But to lap it up, she needs to mount the male.\n\"That places the female in a perfect position,\" Schal explains. \"While she feeds, the male has this telescoping penis. He extends that penis to the end of the female and inserts it.\"\nThe penis has a hook on it, which the male uses to lock onto the female's genitalia for 90 minutes — the length of time it takes him to create a sperm package, which he then transfers to the female.\nSo when it comes to making baby roaches, having a tasty nuptial gift is key. That's why these gifts are often full of glucose, a simple sugar that's a basic source of energy for many living things.\nFemale cockroach accepts nuptial gift\nCredit: Ayako Wada-Katsumata\nAnd it's this love for glucose that pest controllers started exploiting in the mid-1980s. They made baits laced with an insecticide that were brimming with glucose or other sugars that quickly break down into glucose. The results were immediate: lots of dead German cockroaches.\nBut then, a few years later, a pest-control company noticed something unsettling. \"A population of cockroaches in a Florida apartment just could not be controlled,\" says Schal.\nIt turns out that some of the roaches had evolved a glucose aversion. Glucose no longer tasted sweet to them. It was bitter. \"And therefore,\" Schal says, \"they refused to eat the bait.\"\n\"In the last 10 years, there's been a dramatic increase in the use of baits,\" he says. \"And therefore, I suspect that populations of glucose-averse cockroaches have increased dramatically.\"\nThis alteration gave German cockroaches a major leg up in their arms race against us. But it also created a problem for them: Any glucose in the male's nuptial gift is now repulsive to these glucose-averse females.\n\"Now this female, she immediately interrupts feeding and dismounts the male,\" says Schal. \"She simply walks away. So this poor male has just lost his opportunity to copulate with the female. Suddenly, this adaptive trade becomes maladaptive in a context of sexual interaction.\"\nFemale cockroach rejects nuptial gift\nCredit: Ayako Wada-Katsumata\nBut if there's one thing you can count on, it's that roaches beget more roaches. So when facing an existential crisis like the inability to woo a partner, they always seem to find a workaround. In this case, their solution consists of two genetic changes.\n\"The first one,\" says Schal, \"is that the male changed the chemistry of the nuptial gift that he offers the female.\"\nThat is, he's tinkered with the recipe, reducing the amount of glucose and another simple sugar. And he's elevated the amount of a sugar called maltotriose, which the females love and which doesn't break down into glucose as readily. This means the gift stays sweet.\nThe second change involves the amount of time it takes for the male to lock onto the female's genitalia. Usually, it takes three to four seconds. But the males have managed to shave off more than a second \"before the female senses the presence of glucose in her mouth,\" says Schal.\n\"Overall, the male solution is to buy more time but speed up his copulatory attempt,\" he says.\nWare, the entomologist who wasn't involved in the research, applauds the new work.\n\"It shows how this elaborate behavior [of this nuptial gift], which evolved presumably over hundreds of millions of years, has in just a short period of time been altered dramatically by humans,\" she says.\nSo perhaps now is a good time to reformulate the bait, maybe by adding some kind of fat, says Schal. However, even if we succeed in tricking the roaches once more, it probably won't be long before their numbers begin to crawl upwards again.","extracted_keywords":["glucose","male","female","cockroaches","gift","roaches","time","cockroach","control","males"]}
{"url":"https://www.npr.org/transcripts/374737120","title":"The Zig-Zagging History Of The Number Zero : NPR","extracted_core_text":"ERIC WESTERVELT, HOST:\nSo think of all the numbers you've encountered today - the clock in your smartphone, maybe the date on your calendar, the numbers on that highway sign. And those are just the ones you can see. It's easy to take numbers for granted. They're the scaffolding that our economy, our technology, huge parts of our daily life, are built on. But there was a time when a zigzagging line didn't mean two and a vertical line didn't mean one and a circle didn't mean zero. Just how that system developed is a question that's fascinated Amir Aczel since his childhood. He's a math and science writer, and his new book is \"Finding Zero: A Mathematician's Odyssey To Uncover The Origins Of Numbers.\"\nAMIR ACZEL: To me, the invention or discovery of numbers is the greatest intellectual invention of the human mind. I have say invention or discovery because that's a huge problem in the philosophy of mathematics. Did we invent numbers, or do they exist regardless of us? But writing numbers is certainly an invention, and that invention is what has obsessed me all of my life.\nWESTERVELT: You also explore some of the faults, starts and dead-ends along the way to our current system of numbers, which are known as Hindu- Arabic numerals. Could you talk about some of the number systems that, I guess you could say, have gone extinct?\nACZEL: Right. The Maya had a very interesting number which they used in calendars. And there was a zero there, actually. That number system didn't go anywhere. And then of course, there's the Babylonian number, (unintelligible) numbers, and they did not really have a zero. Sometimes they'd leave a space. And the best example - and my favorite - is the Roman numerals. And if you want to try something interesting with the Roman numerals, try to create the multiplication table and you can see it's very complicated. So and, the reason is that the numbers don't cycle. They have to use, say, L for 50 and C for 100. So it's unique, while we can use the same sign, like two, in different places. Two with a zero after it is 20. Two alone is just two. You can create numbers using the cyclicity of the numerals. And that's something that no other number system that I know of has.\nWESTERVELT: Why is zero, specifically, so important?\nACZEL: Without a zero, you couldn't allow the numerals to cycle. You couldn't do this example that I gave, the two followed by zero stands for 20, creating that great economy where just nine signs plus a zero allow us to write any number that we want.\nWESTERVELT: What sparked your interest in finding the origin of zero? You take us on this quest around the world.\nACZEL: I first became interested in numbers - my father was a ship's captain for cruise ship in the Mediterranean, and one of the favorite ports was Monte Carlo. And what I saw there were these numerals, and they're very beautiful, on a roulette table in the fanciest casino in the world. These numerals just captured me, my attention and my fascination. And it sort of - that really led me to pursue a career in mathematics and statistics. And then I became very interested in where these numerals came from. Everybody says, oh, numbers come from India. And I wanted to know how they came from India, and then I became aware of the big controversy with British scholar G. R. Kaye.\nWESTERVELT: Who was convinced that the zero came from the West.\nACZEL: Exactly, and he was actually an expert on India, but he was biased. He writes in one of his papers, like, Indians think that their history started several million years ago and of course this is nonsense and the numerals don't come from India.\nAnd the person I follow in the book, Georges Coedes, a French scholar, tried to prove the opposite. And this particular style that I'm after throughout this book that I'm trying to find is that zero that he used to defeat Kaye and his followers.\nWESTERVELT: Your book is called \"Finding Zero,\" so this isn't really a spoiler. I mean, you traced the earliest-known written representation of zero to this crumbling 7th century tablet that you find in Cambodia, and its stacked amid ruins of other ancient artifacts. What was going through your mind?\nACZEL: It's the greatest euphoria in my life. And I have a feeling I'll never have a moment like that ever again. And I just looked at it. I couldn't dare touch it, as if it were fragile - which it wasn't, it's a piece of stone weighing several tons. Greatest moment in my life.\nWESTERVELT: Tell us its significance, what it said. Where was the zero, and what did the zero mean there in that writing?\nACZEL: Well, it says Chaka 605 began in the fifth day of the waning moon. So it's really an astronomical description of the beginning of a year and a calendar called Chaka. So luckily, they had the date there. So because the date has a zero, we have the first zero. And they had to write a zero. And what the rest of the tablet talks about is about slaves to be given to a king and sacks of white rice and several other things. So it's a list of gifts to a local king.\nWESTERVELT: Amir, we knew this tablet existed. I mean, why was it so important to find the physical object?\nACZEL: Well, often times you read when you do research about something that disappeared. And when something is gone, it's really far from being the same anymore. To me, it was important to recover this artifact with the earliest zero because I feel it's important to see it and continue to study it. And there's a monument to this great invention of the human mind, the ability to write something down that represents complete nothingness.\nWESTERVELT: Amir Aczel speaking with us from WGBH in Boston. His new book is called \"Finding Zero.\" Thanks so much for speaking with us.\nACZEL: Thank you very much. It was my pleasure.\nCopyright © 2015 NPR. All rights reserved.

We were hanging out in the bedroom.\nWEINSTEIN: (As Claire) The gay kid?\nDOHENY: (As Alex) Yeah. He's going to this show in Brooklyn, and he has an extra ticket, so, you know.\nWEINSTEIN: (As Claire) Whoa, Brooklyn, look at you, hipster man.\nDOHENY: (As Alex) Yeah. You can come if you want, but I think he only has one ticket.\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Craig Johnson, who wrote and directed \"Alex Strangelove,\" told us the story is largely autobiographical, but is he an Alex or an Elliott?\nCRAIG JOHNSON: Oh, I was Alex 100 percent. I was confused and overwhelmed and anxiety ridden about sex, dating, the whole nine yards. But you know what? It didn't take long for me to realize that that's a pretty universal feeling for teenagers.\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: It is very typical, but I think there's an added thing - right? - which is when you're trying to decide or uncover what it is that you really want and who it is that you really are.\nJOHNSON: Yeah. Well, one of the centerpiece storylines in this is Alex's relationship with Claire, his girlfriend...\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Right, played by Madeline Weinstein.\nJOHNSON: Yeah - who he loves very much and very authentically, but it gets confusing when he meets this kid Elliott who he's also attracted to. And I think what is sort of at least fresh to me about the story was that Alex's conflicts are not so much external. You know, he goes to a pretty progressive high school. It's not like, you know, he's going to get beat up if he comes out of the closet. So the conflict becomes internal. It becomes what am I really into? It's OK to date boys now in high school. It's OK to date girls. So it's all on me. Where do I fall into all of this? And that's kind of what the movie is about.\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Yeah. But there's also a deep undercurrent there that I couldn't help coming back to, which is as a girl also who's young and trying to figure out her sexuality, to be in a relationship with someone who may not be heterosexual is painful and difficult and makes you question all sorts of things about yourself. And on the other side, you have Elliott, who also is interested in Alex, and he's out and he's very sure of who he is, but he's not sure what kind of relationship he's going to have with Alex going forward. And so there's just a lot of sort of - I don't know - collateral damage around that.\nJOHNSON: There is, very much so. And that just is pulled from my experience in life. But I wanted to honor that relationship between Alex and Claire, and I wanted to see it from Claire's perspective. I wanted to see the heartbreak. I wanted to see the crappiness of it and kind of the inevitability of it but then also how you deal. You know, I was very interested in what choices Claire had once she realized that it wasn't going to work out for her.\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: I want to talk about the high school because you brought it up. So this high school, the kids, you know, throw around terms like polyamorous and genderqueer. Was there a school that you modeled that on?\nJOHNSON: Well, you know what? It's based on my observations of teenagers, especially more so over the last couple years. There's really been a sea change in kind of the open-mindedness of teenagers - not everywhere, for sure, not everywhere, but I have noticed that when it comes to sort of embracing and accepting sort of sexual experimentation and gender identity experimentation, kids are a bit more open to it. And so I wanted Alex to go to kind of a progressive high school. I just thought it made actually the conflict more dramatic because it made it all about what am I really into, which doesn't necessarily make dating and sex in high school any easier. It kind of makes it harder. You get paralyzed by choice.\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Yeah. In fact, there's a scene in the film where one of Alex's friends talks about exactly that - a lot of choice.\nJOHNSON: Yeah, that's his buddy Dell, who is kind of a little bit of a dweeby (ph) pipsqueak. He's a straight kid, and he's just a little overwhelmed by the sea change and just trying to make sense of it in his own sort of goofy way.\n(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ALEX STRANGELOVE\")\nDANIEL ZOLGHADRI: (As Dell) It's like \"Mad Max\" out here, you know? Guys doing guys, girls doing girls - not that I object to that - girls turning into guys and doing girls that used to do girls and guys. Isn't anyone just plain straight anymore?\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: (Laughter) Let me ask you this - as a filmmaker tackling these kinds of stories, you say that there's something in the air. Do you really think that this is a different moment? Because clearly there are two competing narratives happening in this country about whether or not we should be entertaining these kinds of storylines and talks.\nJOHNSON: Right, right. There are two competing narratives, but I got to say I think the gorilla is out of the cage, you know? You're not going to put the toothpaste back in the tube on this issue. I feel like the national legalization of gay marriage really did so much to just sort of justify and to legitimize LGBTQ relationships. And with those floodgates open, I felt in the last couple years I started to see so many stories, so many movies, with LGBT storylines. And you saw kids kind of shrugging their shoulders about it, you know, where - my own experience, I've met, you know, my friends who have young teenagers, and they're coming out of the closet in middle school. And they just have role models that I certainly didn't have. So the moment is just based on kind of what I've noticed and what I've seen and what I've felt, again especially over the last couple years.\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Craig Johnson - his new film is \"Alex Strangelove\" and it's out now on Netflix.

About 3,100 patients who are 20 and younger are diagnosed with ALL each year.\n\"We're entering a new frontier in medical innovation with the ability to reprogram a patient's own cells to attack a deadly cancer,\" FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a written statement.\n\"New technologies such as gene and cell therapies hold out the potential to transform medicine and create an inflection point in our ability to treat and even cure many intractable illnesses,\" Gottlieb said.\nThe treatment involves removing immune system cells known as T cells from each patient and genetically modifying the cells in the laboratory to attack and kill leukemia cells. The genetically modified cells are then infused back into patients. It's also known as CAR-T cell therapy.\n\"Kymriah is a first-of-its-kind treatment approach that fills an important unmet need for children and young adults with this serious disease,\" said Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.\n\"Not only does Kymriah provide these patients with a new treatment option where very limited options existed, but a treatment option that has shown promising remission and survival rates in clinical trials,\" Marks said in the FDA statement.\nThe treatment, which is also called CTL019, produced remission within three months in 83 percent of 63 pediatric and young adult patients. The patients had failed to respond to standard treatments or had suffered relapses. Based on those results, an FDA advisory panel recommended the approval in July.\nThe treatment does carry risks, however, including a dangerous overreaction by the immune system known as cytokine-release syndrome. As a result, the FDA is requiring strong warnings.\nIn addition, the treatment will be initially available only at 32 hospitals and clinics that have been specially trained in administering the therapy.\nNovartis, which developed the drug, says the one-time treatment will cost $475,000 for patients who respond. People who do not respond within a month would not be charged, and the company said it is taking additional steps to make sure everyone who needs the drug can afford it\nBut some patient advocates criticized the cost nevertheless.\n\"While Novartis' decision to set a price at $475,000 per treatment may be seen by some as restraint, we believe it is excessive,\" says David Mitchell, founder and president of Patients For Affordable Drugs. \"Let's remember, American taxpayers invested over $200 million in CAR-T's discovery.\"\nCorrection Aug. 30, 2017\nA previous version of this story referred to the treatment as CTL109. The correct name is CTL019.","extracted_keywords":["treatment","cells","patients","drug","cancer","cell","therapy","approval","gene","children"]}

{"url":"https://www.npr.org/transcripts/618323491","title":"A Campaign For 'Often The Hardest-Working People On Stage' — The Chorus : NPR","extracted_core_text":"A Campaign For 'Often The Hardest-Working People On Stage' — The Chorus\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:\nTonight, the 2018 Tony Awards, Broadway's highest honors, will be handed out at Radio City Music Hall. They'll go to lead and featured actors in plays and musicals but can't go to some performers who shared the stage with those leads. Jeff Lunden went to find out why the chorus of a musical might deserve its own Tony Award.\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSICAL, \"A CHORUS LINE\")\nJEFF LUNDEN, BYLINE: Remember \"A Chorus Line?\"\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSICAL, \"A CHORUS LINE\")\nUNIDENTIFIED ACTORS: (As characters, singing) One singular sensation every little step she takes.\nLUNDEN: That immensely popular 1975 musical looked at the stories of some of the people who often work completely anonymously on Broadway. Kate Shindle is president of Actors Equity, the union that represents actors and stage managers. She says chorus members not only sing and dance but sometimes play instruments or move scenery.\nKATE SHINDLE: Often the hardest-working people on stage in a lot of respects who could never really be recognized for that work.\nLUNDEN: Equity wants to change that. It's petitioning the Tony Administration Committee to not only consider choruses for awards but their counterparts in plays known as ensembles.\nSHINDLE: There is a misperception, I think, sometimes in our industry that everybody's trying to be a principal actor, and that's not the reality. There are also people who go from show to show to show and they're not trying to get their name above the title. They just want to be a part of the community.\nLUNDEN: That's a perfect description of John Treacy Egan, a burly actor with a sweet voice. He has played lead roles on Broadway, but in the Tony-nominated revival of \"My Fair Lady,\" he's in the chorus, alternating between a snooty, upper crust lord and a cockney street seller.\nJOHN TREACY EGAN: I'm one of the four costermongers who are in the street scene in Covent Garden where we meet Eliza Doolittle and then get to sing that beautiful four-part harmony of \"Wouldn't It Be Loverly\" with her.\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSICAL, \"MY FAIR LADY\")\nUNIDENTIFIED ACTORS: (Singing) Wouldn't it be loverly.\nEGAN: (As costermonger) Where ya bound for this spring Eliza? Biarritz?\nLUNDEN: Egan gets a few solo lines in the show, but most of the time he's one of 25 chorus members.\nEGAN: We're down in the dungeon.\nLUNDEN: He changes costumes in the depths of Lincoln Center Theater's basement.\nEGAN: Some little gel in the hair so I don't look so freshly washed.\nLUNDEN: He needs one more touch before he can go on stage. He heads back upstairs, down another hall, to the wig room to get mutton chop sideburns slapped on.\n(SOUNDBITE OF SMACKING)\nEGAN: She has to smack them to make sure they stay on.\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Hey, hey, everybody, this is five minutes, five minutes to curtain call please.\nEGAN: Perfect.\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Five minutes, five minutes.\nEGAN: Now my call is five minutes, so we're ahead of the game.\nLUNDEN: And five minutes later, the show starts.\nEGAN: Oh, we've started.\nLUNDEN: \"My Fair Lady\" is a fairly typical musical from Broadway's golden age. Egan's in several numbers, but he has a lot of downtime in between long scenes that feature the lead actors, or principals.\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSICAL, \"MEAN GIRLS\")\nBARRETT WILBERT WEED: (As Janis Sarkisian) Now you know, Cady, Regina George is not your friend. We're your friends.\nLUNDEN: Over at the Tony-nominated musical \"Mean Girls,\" set in high school, the pace is quicker. The chorus is on stage almost all the time, says Kamille Upshaw, a Juilliard-trained dancer as she limbers up before the show.\nKAMILLE UPSHAW: And if we're not on stage, we're changing, which is just as tiring. If we could just sit for two seconds, that would be nice, but we don't have that luxury.\nLUNDEN: This is only Upshaw's second Broadway show. Her first was \"Hamilton.\"\nUPSHAW: The thing about both of these shows which I really love is that the ensemble's used to its capacity as a storytelling mechanism, and that's to create a world around what's happening with the principals.\nLUNDEN: In other words, the chorus or the ensemble isn't just stage dressing. Upshaw and Egan have created their own characters with their own personas. And Egan says while they're on stage standing behind the leads, they have to look like they're talking about something that has to do with the show even if they're not.\nEGAN: You can be talking about where you're going to dinner, but you have to make it look like you're talking about something that's happening onstage. The audience can tell if they're looking.\nLUNDEN: And what happens backstage is as important as what happens on stage, says Kamille Upshaw at \"Mean Girls.\"\nUPSHAW: It's very choreographed. You have to know where to stand. You have to know when this prop goes off. We move everything in the show, so we move the lunch tables. These things are heavy. So we had to develop a system as to how we could do that as a unit and not be injured. Broadway's hard (laughter). It is. It's hard, but I love what I do so it makes it very easy to come to work every day.\nLUNDEN: For his part, John Treacy Egan says even though he's been performing on Broadway for 20 years, he still gets goosebumps.\nEGAN: Sometimes you wake up and you go, oh, my gosh. I'm going to go be in a Broadway show today.\nLUNDEN: Both of them will be seen on the Tony Awards broadcast tonight even though they won't be eligible to win that shiny medallion yet.

In the past, Wheatley's condition would have probably killed him before his first birthday. Guardino's would have blinded him early in life.\nBut after receiving experimental gene therapies, both seem to be doing fine.\n\"It's a very exciting time for the field,\" says Carrie Wolinetz, the associate director for science policy at the National Institutes of Health.\nSo far, gene therapy has only been tested on a relatively small number of patients who have been followed for relatively short periods of time. Many more patients will have to be studied for longer periods before anyone really knows how well the therapies work, how long the benefits last, and whether the therapies are safe.\nBut doctors and families of those helped so far are elated at the progress.\n\"This is really an important time in gene therapy,\" says Dr. David Williams, professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School and chief scientific officer at Boston Children's Hospital, who was not involved in these children's treatment, but has recently achieved similar success with another genetic condition.\nEli's mother, Natalie Wheatley, had been terrified there was something wrong with Eli even before he was born. He barely moved during her pregnancy, she recalls, and never seemed quite right in the first weeks of his life.\nFinally, doctors told her that her worst fears were true: Her son had spinal muscular atrophy, a disease of motor neurons that was destroying his muscles.\n\"They basically told me he wouldn't make it to his first birthday,\" says Wheatley. Take him home and love him and spend as much time with him as you can, she remembers the health team telling her.\n\"I was devastated — devastated,\" she says.\nGuardino was diagnosed with a different condition — Leber's congenital amaurosis, a disease of the eye's retina — when he was born. The disorder isn't fatal. But it was destroying his vision.\n\"I wouldn't be able to walk around outside on my own,\" says Guardino. During the day, he says, the world looked \"incredibly dark\" and blurry. \"It was sort of like watching your world fade away.\"\nNow Guardino can see things he'd only dreamed about.\nAfter the gene therapy treatment, he says, \"I was able to see things for the first time — like the moon. I was able to see stars for the first time – fireworks — all these amazing things that I've never been able to see before.\"\nAnd Wheatley's son, Eli, seems to be thriving.\n\"He just started preschool in September,\" his mom says. \"He goes to preschool alone. He eats in the cafeteria with all the other kids. He's doing extremely well. It's been amazing — truly amazing.\"\nRecent success in these different cases \"really shows us we're able to harness this therapy for some pretty terrible diseases,\" says Williams, who reported last month in the New England Journal of Medicine that gene therapy can also halt the progression of disease in boys suffering from adrenoleukodystrophy, a fatal genetic brain disease made famous by the movie Lorenzo's Oil.\nScientists thought this sort of success would come decades ago. But their first attempts to save people born with defective genes by giving them new, healthy genes fizzled. Some patients who volunteered for early experiments developed cancer. At least one person died.\n\"And that caused a setback in the field, which caused a lot of concern that maybe gene therapy was not ready for prime time,\" the NIH's Wolinetz says.\nSome scientists feared gene therapy might never work. Researchers went back to the drawing board to come up with better, safer ways to use viruses to deliver healthy genes into a person's body. It's those decades of research that finally seem to be paying off.\n\"We have reached a point of maturation in the science and in some of the new approaches to gene therapy that have allowed us to make rapid advancements in a fairly short period of time,\" Wolinetz says.\nThe price tag of such a treatment remains a looming question. The first gene therapy product approved by the Food and Drug Administration (a treatment for a form of leukemia, approved last summer) costs hundreds of thousands of dollars for each infusion. Some drug industry analysts predict the next gene therapy could cost close to $1 million per patient.\nDr. Peter Bach, director of the center for health policy and outcomes at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, says he's thrilled with the scientific progress that's been made in the field — but the cost of gene therapy drugs troubles him.\n\"The model by which every innovation is turned around to extract the maximum amount of profit is ultimately taking away our ability to adequately fund many other things that promote health,\" Bach says.\nWhatever the questions and costs, people who have been helped by these treatments so far seem delighted.\n\"I think that the gene therapy is a miracle,\" Guardino says. \"I can't imagine what my life would be like without it.\"\nNatalie Wheatley, whose son Eli was among those described in another study, published early this month in the New England Journal of Medicine, says her son seems to continue to improve.\n\"I see progress every day,\" Wheatley says. \"So that, to me, offers hope that gene therapy has saved his life. And I think eventually gene therapy will give the world hope. That's my hope anyways.\"\nThe FDA could soon approve for non-experimental use the first gene therapy for a genetic disorder — the treatment Guardino received to save his vision.\nMeanwhile, scientists are starting to test other forms of gene therapy for a long list of other diseases, including many that are much more common.","extracted_keywords":["gene","therapy","time","treatment","patients","life","son","disease","things","list"]}

It was like sunglasses over my eyes while looking through a little tunnel,\" 18-year-old Misty Lovelace of Kentucky told the committee. \"I can honestly say my biggest dream came true when I got my sight. I would never give it up for anything. It was truly a miracle.\"\nSeveral young people described being able to ride bicycles, play baseball, see their parents' faces, read, write and venture out of their homes alone at night for the first time.\n\"I've been able to see things that I've never seen before, like stars, fireworks, and even the moon,\" Christian Guardino, 17, of Long Island, N.Y., told the committee. \"I will forever be grateful for receiving gene therapy.\"\nThe FDA isn't obligated to follow the recommendations of its advisory committees, but it usually does.\nIf the treatment is approved, one concern is cost. Some analysts have speculated it could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to treat each eye, meaning the cost for each patient could approach $1 million.\nSpark Therapeutics of Philadelphia, which developed the treatment, hasn't said how much the company would charge. But the company has said it would help patients get access to the treatment.\nDespite the likely steep price tag, the panel's endorsement was welcomed by scientists working in the field.\n\"It's one of the most exciting things for our field in recent memory,\" says Paul Yang, an assistant professor of ophthalmology at the Oregon Health and Science University who wasn't involved in developing or testing the treatment.\n\"This would be the first approved treatment of any sort for this condition and the first approved gene therapy treatment for the eye, in general,\" Yang says. \"So, on multiple fronts, it's a first and ushers in a new era of gene therapy.\"\nEver since scientists began to unravel the genetic causes of diseases, doctors have dreamed of treating them by fixing defective genes or giving patients new, healthy genes. But those hopes dimmed when early attempts failed and sometimes even resulted in the deaths of volunteers in early studies.\nBut the field may have finally reached a turning point. The FDA recently approved the first so-called gene therapy product, which uses genetically modified cells from the immune system to treat a form of leukemia. And last week, scientists reported using gene therapy to successfully treat patients suffering from cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy, or ALD, a rare, fatal brain disease portrayed in the film Lorenzo's Oil. Researchers are also testing gene therapy for other causes of blindness and blood disorders such as sickle cell disease.\nThe gene therapy endorsed by the committee Thursday was developed for RPE65-mutation associated retinal dystrophy, which is caused by a defective gene that damages cells in the retina. About 6,000 people have the disease worldwide, including 1,000 to 2,000 people in the United States.\nThe treatment, which is called voretigene neparvovec, involves a genetically modified version of a harmless virus. The virus is modified to carry a healthy version of the gene into the retina. Doctors inject billions of modified viruses into both of a patient's eyes.\nIn a study involving 29 patients, ages 4 to 44, the treatment appeared to be safe and effective. More than 90 percent of the treated patients showed at least some improvement in their vision when tested in a specially designed obstacle course. The improvement often began within days of the treatment.\n\"Many went from being legally blind to not being legally blind,\" said Albert Maguire, a professor of ophthalmology who led the study at the University of Pennsylvania, in an interview before the hearing.\nThe improvement varied from patient to patient, and none of the patients regained normal vision. But some had a significant increase in their ability to see, especially at night or in dim light, which is a major problem for patients with this condition.\n\"What I saw in the clinic was remarkable,\" Maguire told the committee. \"Most patients became sure of themselves and pushed aside their guides. Rarely did I see a cane after treatment.\"\nThat was the case of Allison Corona, who's now 25 and lives in Glen Head, N.Y. She underwent the treatment five years ago as part of the study.\n\"My light perception has improved tremendously,\" Corona said during an interview before the hearing. \"It's been life-changing. I am able to see so much better. I am so much more independent than what I was. It is so much better.\"\nThe patients have been followed for more than three years, and the effects appear to be lasting. \"We have yet to see deterioration,\" Maguire says. \"So far the improvement is sustained.\"\nThe injections themselves did cause complications in a few patients, such as a serious infection that resulted in permanent damage, and a dangerous increase in pressure in the eye. But there were no adverse reactions or any signs of problems associated with the gene therapy itself, the researchers reported.\nWhile this disease is rare, the same approach could work for similar forms of genetic eye disease, Maguire says.\"There are a lot of retinal diseases like this, and if you added them together it's a big thing because they are all incurable.\"\nIf approved, the treatment would be marketed under the name Luxturna.","extracted_keywords":["treatment","gene","therapy","patients","disease","committee","form","eye","patient","improvement"]}

And the night before graduation, one of them has an epiphany.\n(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"BOOKSMART\")\nBEANIE FELDSTEIN: (As Molly) We chose. We didn't party because we wanted to focus on school and get into good colleges.\nKAITLYN DEVER: (As Amy) And it worked.\nFELDSTEIN: (As Molly) But the irresponsible people who partied also got into those colleges, they did both.\nDEVER: (As Amy) So?\nFELDSTEIN: (As Molly) So we messed up. We didn't have to choose. They did both.\nKELLY: Thus is hatched a plan. Molly and Amy set out to cram four years of everything they have missed out on into one night.\n(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"BOOKSMART\")\nFELDSTEIN: (As Molly) We have to go to a party tonight.\nDEVER: (As Amy) What?\nFELDSTEIN: (As Molly) Let's go to Nick's party.\nDEVER: (As Amy) Are you kidding? No. No way.\nFELDSTEIN: (As Molly) We only have one night left to have studied and partied in high school, otherwise we're just going to be the girls that missed out.\nKELLY: That is the stunningly simple premise of \"Booksmart,\" which hits theaters today. But if the premise is simple, the director's ambitions are not. Olivia Wilde says she wants the film to be a generational anthem. And Olivia Wilde joins us now. Hi there.\nOLIVIA WILDE: Hello.\nKELLY: You set yourself a completely unambitious goal here - making a generational anthem of a movie.\nWILDE: (Laughter).\nKELLY: Tell me what you mean by that. What's it mean?\nWILDE: Well, you know, I made this movie as a love letter to the movies I grew up on and, in fact, the movies that made me fall in love with film.\nKELLY: Like what?\nWILDE: I grew up watching \"The Breakfast Club\" and \"Say Anything,\" \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off,\" \"Clueless.\" Those movies were more than just movies to me. It kind of contextualized the adolescent experience for me. They made me excited to be young. And that was my goal with this movie. It was to allow this young generation - Generation Z - to feel that they had been kind of immortalized.\nKELLY: So this is not your generation exactly. I should mention you're in your 30s. How did you go about trying to make a movie that would feel like the really authentic voice of a generation that you're not part of?\nWILDE: Well, I was lucky enough to have a cast that actually does come from this young generation. And I really wanted them to infuse their characters with their own voices and their own ideas. And when I hired them, I brought them together and said, we're going to read the script. And every time something feels inauthentic, I want you to raise your hand and tell me. If there's a moment that you think could sound more organic, I just want you to rewrite it in your own voice. Like, there used to be a line in the script where Molly said to Amy, you've been out for two years and you've never had a lesbian experience. I want that for you. And when we were rehearsing, the girls called me over and said, you know, Liv, we don't really say lesbian experience. We would just say experience.\n(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"BOOKSMART\")\nFELDSTEIN: (As Molly) You've been out for two years and you've never kissed a girl. I want you to experience this.\nWILDE: Whereas, you know, 10 to 13 years ago, when I was playing a young queer woman on network television on \"The O.C.,\" it was a very different conversation. It was all about owning labels and being very upfront about labels.\nKELLY: Yeah. The script - I saw you've been through a zillion drafts, even more than I gather is typical in Hollywood. And the original one was from a decade ago, from 2009.\nWILDE: Yes.\nKELLY: And the country has changed so much. Did the script have to change so much to feel authentic and relevant now?\nWILDE: Yes. The scripts really evolved. When I came on board in 2016, it was ripe for another rewrite. And I wanted to update it to allow it to really reflect what I was hearing from young people today.\nKELLY: Can you give me an example of what changed?\nWILDE: Well, yes - the notion that the other students had also gotten into really good colleges. That was an important one for us because we wanted to show that this film was also discussing judgment and the idea of putting one another into categories.\nKELLY: You open the movie with that, with Molly thinking about how she's looking down on everyone who's ever given her grief.\nWILDE: Exactly.\nKELLY: And she's going to yell and she's going to show them all.\n(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"BOOKSMART\")\nMAYA RUDOLPH: (As Motivational Voice) Stand atop the mountain of your success, and look down at everyone who's ever doubted you.\nWILDE: Whereas you think this is going to be a movie about two nerdy young women who are eager to assimilate, to be accepted by their peers, what it really is is a story of two very smart young women who are unapologetic about their intelligence, who go through a transformation to realize that they have misunderstood their peers to be one-dimensional, when actually, everyone around them is also very smart. They've just been living their lives differently.\nKELLY: OK. So let's talk about Molly and Amy because their friendship, which is fierce, which is brutally honest, this lovely female friendship is the heart of the movie. They, like probably pretty much all best friends, sometimes talk in code.\n(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"BOOKSMART\")\nFELDSTEIN: (As Molly) I'm calling Malala.\nDEVER: (As Amy) Wow. You know you only get like one Malala a year.\nFELDSTEIN: (As Molly) Yeah, I'm calling it - full support, no questions asked. You are coming with me.\nWILDE: Malala is their code word for unconditional support. So what malala means is that what I'm asking you to do now with me you must do.\nKELLY: Is this related to Malala Yousafzai from Pakistan?\nWILDE: Yes, of course.\nKELLY: Who's one of their role models.\nWILDE: Of course. Malala is one of their great role models. And I think that's why she holds the most significant place in their friendship, the idea that if you call Malala, you must really mean it.\nKELLY: But it's so lovely because it speaks to that, you know, if you love me, if you're loyal to me, if you're really my best friend, you're just going to trust me on this one and follow where I'm saying we need to go.\nWILDE: Absolutely. But that's an interesting thing the movie also deals with - loyalty and betrayal - because I think there is something in these very intense friendships in our youth where any sort of resistance is seen as betrayal. And there is a pivotal scene in the film where one character reveals that she isn't actually onboard with the plan that the other thought they had agreed upon. And in that moment, there's a crack in between very, very intense union. And I wanted to highlight that that kind of trauma to a young relationship is something that is necessary in order for relationships to evolve and for us as individuals to evolve. You must be able to tell your closest ally, I disagree with you. I am my own individual.\nKELLY: I read that, on the set, you all talked about how intense these friendships are - your very first best friend, your first soulmate - and that a lot of people ended up reaching out and calling their old high school besties. even ones they had lost touch with over the years. I love that.\nWILDE: It's really great. And people leave and they call their best friend, who they realize is the person who got them through what is a very confusing time in adolescence. I think of that friend as being the person who knew you better than your parents, the person who really allowed you to be vulnerable and in so many ways was more intense and intimate than you the romantic relationships starting around that time or that followed after that.\nKELLY: It's fascinating because you feel like the romantic relationship is the everything in that moment, but it's your best friend who you're still going to be calling decades later.\nWILDE: Exactly. And society gives us, you know, so much context for the romantic relationship. We have very few love songs, movies, stories about friendship - platonic friendship. And yet it is, in so many ways, deeper. Those friendships are incredibly significant. And I just - I hope that this film allows people to look around them and value those friendships even more.\nKELLY: I think our takeaway from this interview is going to be go call your best friend from high school and catch up and say hi.\nWILDE: Exactly.\nKELLY: Olivia Wilde - she is director of \"Booksmart,\" which hits cinemas today. Olivia Wilde, thank you so much. This was a pleasure.\nWILDE: Thank you so much. It's a real honor.\nCopyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

Most of the visit will be photo ops - meeting Japan's new emperor, playing golf and watching a sumo wrestling match with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. But as NPR's Anthony Kuhn reports from Tokyo, if any substantive issues do come up, trade is likely to be one of them.\nANTHONY KUHN, BYLINE: U.S. Ambassador to Japan William Hagerty complained to Japanese media this week that Japan is putting U.S. farmers and ranchers at a disadvantage. It's cut deals with other big agricultural producers like Australia and Canada, lowering tariffs on their exports and allowing them to grab market share in Japan. But experts say that's not exactly the whole picture.\nBRAD GLOSSERMAN: What you're looking at is a U.S. government that is demanding what it could have had and is unfortunately not in a position to acknowledge that.\nKUHN: Brad Glosserman is deputy director of the Tama University Center for Rule Making Strategies in Tokyo. He points out that the U.S. and Japan worked for years on a free trade deal called the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, which President Trump pulled out of. Japan and 10 other countries went ahead without the U.S., and now those countries are reaping the benefits.\nGLOSSERMAN: As one columnist put it, how dare you let me dump you, and how dare Japan let the United States walk away from a deal that would have served its national interest, and somehow it's Japan's fault.\nKUHN: The Trump administration's other big complaint is that Japan exports so many cars to the U.S. that it endangers American national security. Trump has threatened to raise tariffs on them in six months if a deal is not reached. Japan points out that it makes more cars in the U.S. than it exports there, creating tens of thousands of jobs. And Stanford University Japan expert Daniel Sneider says it's hard for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to do much more than that.\nDANIEL SNEIDER: It's very difficult for Abe to make an agreement which effectively shuts down factories and loses jobs in Japan. So, you know, he's got his constituencies, too.\nKUHN: Japanese investment in the U.S. has surged under the Trump administration, especially in states which voted for Trump in 2016. And, Sneider says, Japan knows Trump can point to this at election time next year. But Abe and his ruling Liberal Democratic Party are facing their own elections in Parliament this year, and Sneider says they can't afford to cut any trade deal that might alienate Japanese rural voters.\nSNEIDER: If they desert the LDP, it could have a huge impact. That happened to them in 2007; Abe lost a big upper house election in 2007, and he's never forgotten that lesson.\nKUHN: Abe's already in his third and probably final term as prime minister, so this election is not about his political survival; it's about his legacy. And Abe's made it clear that his ultimate political goal is to amend Japan's constitution which was drafted by the U.S. after Japan's defeat in World War II. Nihon University political scientist Tomoaki Iwai says Abe and the LDP already have a simple majority in Parliament, but Abe needs more to reach his goal.\nTOMOAKI IWAI: (Through interpreter) If he can't get a two-thirds majority this time, he wouldn't be able to amend the constitution. And if he can't do that, then there'd be no point in him continuing to be a politician.\nKUHN: So Abe may not just be wary of giving anything away to President Trump, Iwai says. He may not want to even bring up the topic of cars and crops. Anthony Kuhn, NPR News, Tokyo.\n(SOUNDBITE OF MELODY'S ECHO CHAMBER'S \"SOME TIME ALONE, ALONE\")\nCopyright © 2019 NPR.

ESPN's Howard Bryant tells NPR's Eric Westervelt what to watch for.\nERIC WESTERVELT, HOST:\nThis is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News. I'm Eric Westervelt. Time now for Sports.\n(MUSIC)\nWESTERVELT: What's new in 2015? College football has at long-last joined the rest of sports, using playoff games to pick a champion instead of that convoluted bowl system. In the NBA, King James has fallen to back and knee injuries - ouch. And speaking of playoffs, it's that time again in the NFL, and here to run it all down for us is Howard Bryant of espn.com and ESPN the magazine.\nHi, Howard. Happy New Year.\nHOWARD BRYANT: Happy New Year, Eric. How are you?\nWESTERVELT: I'm well, thank you. Let's start off with college football. I mean, two semi-final matchups this week produced two pretty clear winners. Oregon destroyed Florida State and Ohio State edged out Alabama. Tell us what happened.\nBRYANT: Well, I think what happened - you know, Oregon - they're just a fantastic football team. They run the ball, they throw it, they do everything. You've got the Heisman Trophy winner Marcus Mariota. And I think that the clock sort of struck 12 on Florida State. They hadn't lost a football game in two years. They were a great team. But it so turned out that they'd had a lot of close games all year, and everybody was wondering when they were finally going to pay for playing relatively average football, but finding a way to win because they had so much talent. But this time, in a playoff system, you run up against another team like Oregon, and they got their doors blown off. They gave up more points than any Florida State team ever had in a bowl game - 59 to 20. And on the other hand, just a great football game between Ohio State and Alabama. And this is exactly what we've been talking about for all these years. Finally, instead of having a computer decide who the national champion is, play it out on the field - great games. And I think that over time, you're going to see them expand these playoffs even more than they have, for finally having them. I think four teams is not enough and after watching what we've seen this weekend, I think that's a good thing.\nWESTERVELT: So they might expand them. And so Ohio State and Oregon - hopefully it'll be a great game - will play for the championship on January 12 in Arlington, Texas. I mean, are those the teams we would've expected to see come out of all this, under the old system?\nBRYANT: Well, I think under the old system you were still going to get Alabama. You were going to get two of those four. I think more than likely you were going to get Alabama and Oregon. I think they were the two best teams coming in. However, Ohio State had earned the right to compete. Under the old system, Ohio State wouldn't have even had a chance to win, and Ohio State might be the most compelling team because they've played with three quarterbacks over the course of the season. They've dealt with injury, and now you're looking at a team that deserves to play for a championship. However, that wouldn't have happened before and you would've had everybody complaining that Ohio State didn't get the opportunity that they deserved. Play it on the field. That's why we watch the games.\nWESTERVELT: Moving on to basketball. In Cleveland, Cavalier and king LeBron James has strains in both his left knee and his back. I mean, knees and back - how worried are Cavs fans, Howard?\nBRYANT: Well, I think when you - the things you don't want (laughter). You don't get hurt at all, but you really don't want to hurt your back and your knees, especially as a basketball player. And I think that in the short term, the Cleveland Cavaliers will be fine. But when I look at LeBron James's injuries, you have to step back and think that he just turned 30, but he's been in the league for 12 years. He's in his 13th season right now. This is the price of not going to college. So he's been playing an NBA season since he was a teenager, and on top of that because he's so good, because his teams are so good, they've gone to the finals the last four straight years. He's been logging many more minutes. He plays every single game. He never gets hurt. And I think I agree with what Byron Scott said - the coach of the Lakers - that the human body was just not meant to play that much basketball. You have to include the Olympics and U.S.A. basketball to that, too. He needs a break.\nWESTERVELT: And Howard, briefly let's go to NFL and playoff time, and let's start with today's games. The Cardinals take on the Panthers, the Ravens take on the Steelers. What are you going to be watching out for?\nBRYANT: Ravens-Steelers is always good because you've got a rivalry game there. And then on top of that, I think Arizona - you feel bad for them because they lost their quarterback, and Carolina - well, they had a losing record so that's not a real compelling game. What I'm really looking forward to is tomorrow. I'm looking forward to the Dallas Cowboys starting a playoff run. That iconic name, the Dallas Cowboys, have not won a Super Bowl in 20 years. They've only won two playoff games. Incredible. They've only won two playoff games during that time since beating the Steelers back in '95. So love 'em, hate 'em, but they are an iconic name. It's great to see them back in the playoffs and I'm hoping that they're more than one-and-done against Detroit tomorrow.\nWESTERVELT: Thanks a lot.

It was like sunglasses over my eyes while looking through a little tunnel,\" 18-year-old Misty Lovelace of Kentucky told the committee. \"I can honestly say my biggest dream came true when I got my sight. I would never give it up for anything. It was truly a miracle.\"\nSeveral young people described being able to ride bicycles, play baseball, see their parents' faces, read, write and venture out of their homes alone at night for the first time.\n\"I've been able to see things that I've never seen before, like stars, fireworks, and even the moon,\" Christian Guardino, 17, of Long Island, N.Y., told the committee. \"I will forever be grateful for receiving gene therapy.\"\nThe FDA isn't obligated to follow the recommendations of its advisory committees, but it usually does.\nIf the treatment is approved, one concern is cost. Some analysts have speculated it could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to treat each eye, meaning the cost for each patient could approach $1 million.\nSpark Therapeutics of Philadelphia, which developed the treatment, hasn't said how much the company would charge. But the company has said it would help patients get access to the treatment.\nDespite the likely steep price tag, the panel's endorsement was welcomed by scientists working in the field.\n\"It's one of the most exciting things for our field in recent memory,\" says Paul Yang, an assistant professor of ophthalmology at the Oregon Health and Science University who wasn't involved in developing or testing the treatment.\n\"This would be the first approved treatment of any sort for this condition and the first approved gene therapy treatment for the eye, in general,\" Yang says. \"So, on multiple fronts, it's a first and ushers in a new era of gene therapy.\"\nEver since scientists began to unravel the genetic causes of diseases, doctors have dreamed of treating them by fixing defective genes or giving patients new, healthy genes. But those hopes dimmed when early attempts failed and sometimes even resulted in the deaths of volunteers in early studies.\nBut the field may have finally reached a turning point. The FDA recently approved the first so-called gene therapy product, which uses genetically modified cells from the immune system to treat a form of leukemia. And last week, scientists reported using gene therapy to successfully treat patients suffering from cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy, or ALD, a rare, fatal brain disease portrayed in the film Lorenzo's Oil. Researchers are also testing gene therapy for other causes of blindness and blood disorders such as sickle cell disease.\nThe gene therapy endorsed by the committee Thursday was developed for RPE65-mutation associated retinal dystrophy, which is caused by a defective gene that damages cells in the retina. About 6,000 people have the disease worldwide, including 1,000 to 2,000 people in the United States.\nThe treatment, which is called voretigene neparvovec, involves a genetically modified version of a harmless virus. The virus is modified to carry a healthy version of the gene into the retina. Doctors inject billions of modified viruses into both of a patient's eyes.\nIn a study involving 29 patients, ages 4 to 44, the treatment appeared to be safe and effective. More than 90 percent of the treated patients showed at least some improvement in their vision when tested in a specially designed obstacle course. The improvement often began within days of the treatment.\n\"Many went from being legally blind to not being legally blind,\" said Albert Maguire, a professor of ophthalmology who led the study at the University of Pennsylvania, in an interview before the hearing.\nThe improvement varied from patient to patient, and none of the patients regained normal vision. But some had a significant increase in their ability to see, especially at night or in dim light, which is a major problem for patients with this condition.\n\"What I saw in the clinic was remarkable,\" Maguire told the committee. \"Most patients became sure of themselves and pushed aside their guides. Rarely did I see a cane after treatment.\"\nThat was the case of Allison Corona, who's now 25 and lives in Glen Head, N.Y. She underwent the treatment five years ago as part of the study.\n\"My light perception has improved tremendously,\" Corona said during an interview before the hearing. \"It's been life-changing. I am able to see so much better. I am so much more independent than what I was. It is so much better.\"\nThe patients have been followed for more than three years, and the effects appear to be lasting. \"We have yet to see deterioration,\" Maguire says. \"So far the improvement is sustained.\"\nThe injections themselves did cause complications in a few patients, such as a serious infection that resulted in permanent damage, and a dangerous increase in pressure in the eye. But there were no adverse reactions or any signs of problems associated with the gene therapy itself, the researchers reported.\nWhile this disease is rare, the same approach could work for similar forms of genetic eye disease, Maguire says.\"There are a lot of retinal diseases like this, and if you added them together it's a big thing because they are all incurable.\"\nIf approved, the treatment would be marketed under the name Luxturna.","extracted_keywords":["treatment","gene","therapy","patients","disease","committee","form","eye","patient","improvement"]}

About 3,100 patients who are 20 and younger are diagnosed with ALL each year.\n\"We're entering a new frontier in medical innovation with the ability to reprogram a patient's own cells to attack a deadly cancer,\" FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a written statement.\n\"New technologies such as gene and cell therapies hold out the potential to transform medicine and create an inflection point in our ability to treat and even cure many intractable illnesses,\" Gottlieb said.\nThe treatment involves removing immune system cells known as T cells from each patient and genetically modifying the cells in the laboratory to attack and kill leukemia cells. The genetically modified cells are then infused back into patients. It's also known as CAR-T cell therapy.\n\"Kymriah is a first-of-its-kind treatment approach that fills an important unmet need for children and young adults with this serious disease,\" said Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.\n\"Not only does Kymriah provide these patients with a new treatment option where very limited options existed, but a treatment option that has shown promising remission and survival rates in clinical trials,\" Marks said in the FDA statement.\nThe treatment, which is also called CTL019, produced remission within three months in 83 percent of 63 pediatric and young adult patients. The patients had failed to respond to standard treatments or had suffered relapses. Based on those results, an FDA advisory panel recommended the approval in July.\nThe treatment does carry risks, however, including a dangerous overreaction by the immune system known as cytokine-release syndrome. As a result, the FDA is requiring strong warnings.\nIn addition, the treatment will be initially available only at 32 hospitals and clinics that have been specially trained in administering the therapy.\nNovartis, which developed the drug, says the one-time treatment will cost $475,000 for patients who respond. People who do not respond within a month would not be charged, and the company said it is taking additional steps to make sure everyone who needs the drug can afford it\nBut some patient advocates criticized the cost nevertheless.\n\"While Novartis' decision to set a price at $475,000 per treatment may be seen by some as restraint, we believe it is excessive,\" says David Mitchell, founder and president of Patients For Affordable Drugs. \"Let's remember, American taxpayers invested over $200 million in CAR-T's discovery.\"\nCorrection Aug. 30, 2017\nA previous version of this story referred to the treatment as CTL109. The correct name is CTL019.","extracted_keywords":["treatment","cells","patients","drug","cancer","cell","therapy","approval","gene","children"]}

A Food and Drug Administration advisory committee unanimously endorsed the first gene therapy for an inherited disorder. NPR health correspondent Rob Stein is with us now for the details. Hey, Rob.\nROB STEIN, BYLINE: Oh, hey there.\nMCEVERS: So let's start by talking about the disease that this gene therapy would be used to treat. Tell us about it.\nSTEIN: Yeah, it's called retinal dystrophy. And it's a genetic disorder that causes progressive damage to the retina in the eye often starting in childhood and slowly leading to blindness. It's a pretty rare disease. There are maybe about 6,000 cases worldwide. A couple of thousand of those are in the United States.\nMCEVERS: And so these 6,000 people could benefit from gene therapy. But what does that mean, gene therapy? How does it work?\nSTEIN: Yeah, it's pretty interesting stuff, Kelly. So what they did is scientists took a harmless virus, and they genetically engineered it to make a - to make it into kind of like a delivery drone to ferry a healthy version of the gene that's defective in this disease into patients' eyes. And then doctors inject billions of these genetically modified viruses into the patients' eyes. That gets the healthy gene into the retina, where it pumps out a healthy version of an enzyme that's needed for healthy vision.\nMCEVERS: How well does it work?\nSTEIN: Well, so far it looks like it's working really well, you know? Now, it's only been tested on a couple of dozen patients so far, but it seemed like almost all of them benefited to some degree, or at least most of them did. For some of them, it was just kind of modest improvement. But for others, their vision started to improve within days of getting these injections.\nAnd it improved pretty dramatically within a year. You know, they went from being legally blind - you know, they were unable to walk around without a cane or someone guiding them. And they were - a lot of them were totally trapped in their houses at night because they had terrible night vision. And then they suddenly could do things they could never do before.\nLike, during today's hearings, some kids got up, and some teenagers described that they could for the first time do things like read, ride a bike, play sports, play baseball, see their parents' faces. You know, and one young man got up and said for the first time, he could go out at night, look up at the sky and see the stars and the moon. It was pretty dramatic, and it really opened up the world for a lot of these people.\nMCEVERS: Wow. So an FDA committee endorses it. So does that mean that it is safe? I mean, are there side effects? And how long might those last?\nSTEIN: Yeah, yeah. So far it seems pretty safe. You know, there sometimes were some complications that occurred from the procedure of injecting something into the eye, the physical procedure. But so far there are no signs at all that the gene therapy itself was dangerous, that injecting a gene into the eye caused any significant complications.\nNow, so far it does seem to be lasting, but that's a big question. How long will it continue to last? These patients have been followed for maybe three years, and it's continuing to work. But they're going to have to follow these patients for longer to be sure.\nMCEVERS: Any idea of how much it would cost?\nSTEIN: So that's a big question. There's a lot of speculations by analysts that it could be pretty expensive. You know, any - some of the newer treatments that have been approved recently have cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. And so you can imagine if this costs, you know, $400,000 or $500,000 for each eye, we're talking about potentially a million-dollar treatment. But the company hasn't said yet what it's going to charge for this product.\nMCEVERS: What does today's news say about where gene therapy stands overall?\nSTEIN: You know, scientists and doctors have been dreaming about doing gene therapy for decades, but early on, there were some real setbacks. Some patients died, and people thought it was never going to happen. But recently there was another treatment approved, and it looks pretty promising for a number of conditions. So it looks like we might be at a turning point here.\nMCEVERS: NPR health correspondent Rob Stein, thanks a lot.\nSTEIN: Oh, sure. Nice to be here.\nCopyright © 2017 NPR. All rights reserved.

This is especially true of mitochondria, because its genomes are so different than the genomes in the nucleus of cells. Slight variations between mitochondrial genomes, he adds, \"turn out to matter a great deal.\"\nMitochondria are the energy powerhouses inside our cells, and they carry their own DNA, separate from our nuclear genome.\nThe danger lies in the fact that mitochondria are in some ways like aliens inside our cells. Two billion years ago they were free-floating bacteria basking in the primordial soup. Then one such microbe merged with another free-floating bacterium, and over evolutionary time, the two formed a complete cell. The bacteria eventually evolved into mitochondria, migrating most of their genes to the cell nucleus and keeping just a few dozen, largely to help them produce energy.\nToday, our nuclear genome contains around 20,000 genes, while a scant 37 genes reside in the mitochondria. And yet the two genomes are intensely symbiotic: 99 percent of mitochondrial proteins are incorporated from the nucleus.\nMitochondria also still divide and replicate like the bacteria they once were, and that constant replication means that mutations arise 10 to 30 times more often in mitochondrial genes than in the nucleus. If too many mitochondria become dysfunctional, the entire cell suffers and serious health problems can result. Faulty mitochondria are implicated in genetic diseases, as well as many chronic conditions from infertility to cancer, cardiac disease and neurodegenerative diseases. That's because when mitochondria falter, the energy system of the cell itself is compromised.\nA three-parent baby could solve the problem by overriding faulty mitochondria, but it also raises the stakes, because the procedure does not completely replace the defective mitochondria with healthy ones.\nWhen the mother's nucleus is transferred, it's like a plant dug up out of ground — a bit of the original soil (in this case, the mother's mitochondria) is still clinging to the roots. That creates a situation that never happens in nature: Two different mitochondrial genomes from two different women are forced to live inside the same cell. In most cases, a tiny percentage (usually less than 2 percent) of the diseased mitochondria remain — but that tiny percentage can really matter.\nIn his new study, Mitalipov crafted three-parent embryos from the eggs of three mothers carrying mutant mitochondrial DNA and from the eggs of 11 healthy women. The embryos were then tweaked to become embryonic stem cells that could live forever, so they could be multiplied and studied. In three cases, the original maternal mitochondrial DNA returned.\n\"That original, maternal mitochondrial DNA took over,\" Mitalipov says, \"and it was pretty drastic. There was less than 1 percent of the original maternal mitochondrial DNA present after replacement with donor DNA and before fertilization, and yet it took over the whole cell later.\"\nMitalipov warns that this reversal might not only occur in the embryonic stem cells; it could also occur in the womb at some point during the development of a baby. Complicating things further, Mitalipov found that some mitochondrial DNA stimulates cells to divide more rapidly, which would mean that a cells containing the maternal mitochondrial DNA could eventually dominate as the embryo developed.\nSome mitochondrial genomes replicate much faster than others, says University of California molecular biologist Patrick O'Farrell, who called Mitalipov's research both impressive and in keeping with his own thinking on the matter.\nA diseased mitochondrial genome could behave like a super-replicating bully, O'Farrell says, re-emerging and having a large impact on the three-parent baby at any time. It could also affect that child's future offspring. \"The diseased genome might stage a sneak comeback to afflict subsequent generations,\" O'Farrell says. On the other hand, he says, the super-replicators could act as \"superheroes,\" if they carry healthy, fit DNA that is able to out-compete a mutant genome.\nThe nuclear genes donated by a father could also influence the behavior of the mitochondria in ways we cannot yet predict, O'Farrell says. For example, the father might introduce new genes that favor the replication rate of a defective bully genome. Or the father might introduce genes that help a \"wimpy\" healthy genome survive and thrive.\nMitalipov's proposed solution to the problem is to match the mitochondria of the mother and the donor, since not all mitochondria are alike. Human mitochondria all over the earth are in a sense a billion or more clones of their original mother, passed down in endless biblical begats from mother to child. Yet, even as clones, they have diverged over time into lineages with different characteristics. These are called haplotypes.\nO'Farrell mentions blood types as a comparison. Just as you would not want to transfuse blood type A into someone with blood type B, you might not want to mix different lineages. And while he says he thinks the idea of matching lineages is brilliant, he suggests going a step further. \"I say let's ... try to get a match with the dominating genome so that the defective genome will ultimately be completely displaced.\"\nIn fact, he adds, the ideal would be to look for one superhero genome, the fastest replicator of all – one that could displace any diseased genome.\nTo find out which branches are super replicators, O'Farrell hopes to collaborate with other laboratories and test the competitive strength of different haplotypes. Earlier this year, O'Farrell's laboratory published work showing that competition between closely related genomes tends to favor the most beneficial, while matchups between distantly related genomes favor super replicators with negative or even lethal consequences. There are, he says, at least 10 major lineages that would be distinct enough to be highly relevant.\nMitalipov says that most of the time, matching haplotypes should ensure successful mitochondrial transfers. However, he cautions that even then, tiny differences in the region of the mitochondrial genome that controls replication speed could cause an unexpected surprise. Even in mitochondria from the same haplotype, there could be a single change in a gene that could cause a conflict, he says.\nIn his study, Mitalipov zeroes in on the region that appears responsible for replication speed. In order to find out a mother's haplotype, he says, full sequencing is necessary, and this region from the donor's egg should also be looked at to be sure it matches the mother's. Today, it costs a few hundred dollars to sequence a woman's mitochondrial genome.\nBut battles between mitochondrial genomes are only one part of the emerging story. Some research suggests that nuclear genes evolve to sync well with a mitochondrial haplotype, and that when the pairing is suddenly switched, health might be compromised.\nResearch in fruit flies and in tiny sea creatures called cephalopods shows that when the \"mitonuclear\" partnership diverges too much, infertility and poor health can result. In some cases, however, the divergent pairs are above average and can actually lead to better health.\nSwapping as little as 0.2 percent of mitochondrial DNA in laboratory animals \"can have profound effects on the function of cells, organs, and even the whole organism, and these effects manifest late in life,\" according to mitochondrial biologist Patrick Chinnery of the University of Cambridge, writing in November in The New England Journal of Medicine.\nBecause of all these unknowns, a U.S. panel recommended last February that mitochondrial replacement therapy, if approved, implant only male embryos so that the human-altered mitochondrial germline would not be passed down through the generations.\nMost scientists approve of this advice, but biologist Damian Dowling of Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, has reservations about even this solution.\nHis own research in fruit flies shows that males may actually be more vulnerable than females to impaired health from mitochondrial replacement. Since females pass on mitochondria, natural selection will help daughters sift out any mutations that might be harmful to them, and keep their nuclear and mitochondrial genes well matched. Males aren't so lucky: If mutations don't harm females but do harm males, the males may have to suffer impaired fertility and go to their graves earlier.\nThis is known as the \"mother's curse\" — a term coined by geneticist Neil Gemmell of the University of Otago in New Zealand to describe the biological baggage that mothers unwittingly pass down to their male babies.\nThe bottom line, according to biologist David Rand of Brown University, who studies mitochondrial genomes, is that when you swap mitochondria, the reaction is \"highly unpredictable.\"\nAnd that's why many experts are calling for caution even amid all the excitement following the three-parent Mexico trial — though there is reason to believe they aren't being heard.\nA three-person baby has now been born in China, and two more may soon be born in Ukraine, according to Nature News. Zhang, meanwhile, continues to encourage potential patients in Mexico: \"We have received interest both locally and abroad,\" he says, \"and we invite people to learn more about the treatment.\"\nDoug Wallace, head of the Center for Mitochondrial and Epigenomic Medicine at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, is among those calling for a more methodical approach to the technique, though he says he doesn't think there's any way to put the brakes on now. \"I think what's happened is we're going to see more and more trials and some families are going to be exceedingly fortunate — and perhaps some will be an unfortunate part of the learning set.\"\nResearch on mitochondria has to catch up, Wallace says, and while matching haplotypes is a good idea, it isn't so easy to do in practice. \"Finding women to be egg donors is going to be a major limitation,\" he says — especially when you'd first have to survey a large group to find compatible mitochondrial DNA.\nStill, for women desperate to conceive a healthy child this may seem reasonable. Wallace adds that mitochondrial replacement therapy might find favor even outside those seeking to avoid passing on fatal genetic mutations — such as older women simply facing reduced fertility. \"There's no proof that's the case,\" he says, but if it came to pass, that could mean a therapy that might change the DNA of tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands, of babies conceived by this method.\nThat would have a real impact on the long-term future of society, Wallace adds, and we don't yet fully understand all of the implications.\n\"I think it's an exciting possibility,\" he says, \"but also a little disconcerting.\"\nJill Neimark is an award-winning science journalist and an author of adult and children's books. Her most recent book is \"The Hugging Tree: A Story About Resilience.\"\nA version of this article originally appeared at Undark, a digital science magazine published by the Knight Science Journalism Fellowship Program at MIT.\nCorrection Jan. 3, 2017\nA previous version of this story referred to tiny sea creatures called cephalopods.

For decades scientists have been dreaming about curing diseases with gene therapy. Those dreams have not become reality, but there's growing excitement now. NPR health correspondent Rob Stein reports.\nROB STEIN, BYLINE: Natalie Wheatley was terrified there might be something wrong with her baby even before he was born. He barely moved during her pregnancy, and after he was born, doctors told her her worst fears were true. He had a terrible incurable genetic disease that was destroying his muscles.\nNATALIE WHEATLEY: Basically told me he wouldn't make it to his first birthday, take him home and love him and spend as much time with him as you could. And I'm going to be honest with you. I was devastated, devastated.\nSTEIN: When Christian Guardino was born, he was also diagnosed with a rare genetic disease. His wasn't fatal but was destroying his vision.\nCHRISTIAN GUARDINO: I wouldn't be able to walk around outside by my own. It would be incredibly dark, blurry and sort of watching your world fade away.\nSTEIN: But Wheatley's son, Eli, is still alive. He's now 3 and seems to be thriving in Lebanon, Ky.\nWHEATLEY: He just started preschool in September. He goes to preschool alone. He eats in the cafeteria with all the other kids. He's doing extremely well, extremely well. It's been amazing. Truly amazing.\nSTEIN: And Christian Guardino, who is 17 and lives in Patchogue, N.Y., can now see things he only dreamed about.\nGUARDINO: I was able to see things for the first time, like the moon. I was able to see stars for the first time, fireworks and all these amazing things I've never been able to see before.\nSTEIN: Eli Wheatley and Christian Guardino are among a growing number of patients whose lives are being saved or radically changed by gene therapy.\nDAVID WILLIAMS: This is really an important time in gene therapy.\nSTEIN: That's David Williams. He's a Harvard scientist who recently reported that gene therapy could cure kids suffering from yet another awful genetic disorder, the fatal brain disease made famous by the movie \"Lorenzo's Oil.\"\nWILLIAMS: It really shows us that we're able to harness this therapy for some pretty terrible diseases so that's just great.\nSTEIN: Scientists thought this would happen a long time ago, but the first attempts to save people with defective genes by giving them new healthy genes fizzled. And Carrie Wolinetz of the National Institutes of Health says some volunteers in early experiments ended up getting cancer. Some even died.\nCARRIE WOLINETZ: And that caused a setback in the field which caused a lot of concern that maybe gene therapy was not ready for prime time.\nSTEIN: And may never be. But scientists went back to their drawing boards to come up with better, safer ways to deliver healthy genes into people's bodies, and that finally seems to be paying off.\nWOLINETZ: I think we have reached a point of maturation in the science and in some of the new approaches to gene therapy that have allowed us to make rapid advancements in a fairly short period of time. So it's a very exciting time for the field.\nSTEIN: Now, gene therapy has still only been tested on a small number of patients for relatively short periods of time. A lot more patients will have to be studied for a lot longer before anyone really knows how well it works, for how long and whether it's really safe. Another big question is the price tag. These new gene therapies cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, perhaps even a million dollars for each patient. And Peter Bach of Memorial Sloan Kettering says that's just too much.\nPETER BACH: Gene therapies, we've been hearing for years that they were going to be a million dollars before we had any product. So now when they come out, everyone's like, well, we expect them to be a million dollars, simply because it's been repeated so much.\nSTEIN: Whatever the questions and cost, people who have been helped by gene therapy are just thrilled. Here's Christian Guardino again, the teenager who regained his vision.\nGUARDINO: I think that the gene therapy is a miracle, and I think I can't imagine my life without gene therapy. I can't imagine what my life would be like without it.\nSTEIN: Natalie Wheatley, whose son, Eli, got gene therapy says he keeps getting better.\nWHEATLEY: I see progress every day. I see progress every day so that to me offers hope that, you know, gene therapy has saved his life. And I think eventually gene therapy will give the world hope. That's my hope, anyways.\nSTEIN: The Food and Drug Administration could approve the first gene therapy for a genetic disorder soon, the one Christian got to save his vision. Meanwhile scientists are starting to test gene therapies for a long list of diseases including many that are much more common.\nRob Stein, NPR News.\nCopyright © 2017 NPR. All rights reserved.

And it's potentially good news for children suffering from a painful and often deadly skin condition called epidermolysis bullosa.\nIn this disease, children are born with a flawed gene that prevents the outer layer of the skin, the epidermis, from binding to the inner layer. This can cause excruciating blisters to form all over these children's bodies.\nIn the case in Europe, a 7-year old boy ended up in the hospital back in 2015 after 60 percent of his epidermis had sloughed off. Tobias Rothoeft, a surgeon at a burn unit at Ruhr University in Bochum, Germany, says he and his colleagues tried everything — including a skin transplant from the boy's father — to no avail.\n\"After nearly two months we were absolutely sure there was nothing we could do for this kid and that he would die,\" Rothoeft said in a telephone news conference hosted by Nature, which published the study online Wednesday.\nRothoeft and his colleagues took one last look around the medical literature and learned of researchers in Italy who were experimenting with a new treatment for this disease. Michele De Luca and colleagues at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia were genetically engineering skin cells to repair the inborn flaw.\nDe Luca used a virus to insert a healthy gene into cells taken from the boy's skin. Some of those cells, stem cells, multiply indefinitely. So De Luca was able to grow entire sheets of engineered epidermis, which were shipped to the hospital in Germany.\nDe Luca had used this procedure successfully in 2006 to replace a relatively small patch of skin on another patient. But this boy needed to have 80 percent of his skin replaced with grafts of this genetically modified material. It took two operations, both in the fall of 2015.\n\"In the first one, we grafted all four limbs,\" De Luca told reporters in the press call. \"In the second operation we grafted the remaining part of the body, mainly the back.\"\nAfter eight months in the intensive care unit, the boy was well enough to go home. And, two years later, he is in school, even playing soccer.\n\"The kid is doing quite well,\" Rothoeft said. \"The skin is of good quality, it doesn't need any ointments or stuff like that. It's perfectly smooth and it is quite stable. And if he gets any bruises, they just heal like bruises in every other kid.\"\nOne lingering question is the concern that gene therapies like this, involving viruses, can increase the risk of cancer. That's because the viruses insert the new gene randomly into human DNA. An attempt at using gene therapy to treat severe combined immuneodeficiency (SCID) in 2002 ended up triggering cancer in some patients.\nThat bad result set back the field of gene therapy, though there have since been successes treating SCID, and most recently, cancer.\n\"Certainly it is a potential problem,\" De Luca said. But he generated hundreds of millions of cells during this procedure and didn't see anything of concern. And in this case, clearly the benefits of treating the boy outweighed the risks.\nNews of this is just starting to trickle out to advocates who have children with epidermolysis bullosa.\n\"I think it's groundbreaking,\" says Brett Kopelan, who heads a U.S. organization focused on this disease, known by its acronym, debra. \"I think it's incredibly exciting.\"\nHis 10-year-old daughter Rafi has a severe case.\n\"Imagine the last time you had a paper cut and you put some Purell on it and it stung, right?\" Kopelan says. \"Now imagine that being 60 percent of your body.\n\"When you have to do a bath and bandage change every day, you are subjected to severe torture. It's incredibly painful, and it can take up to 3 to 4 hours a day,\" he says. \"As a parent, there's not a day that goes by that a little bit of my heart doesn't break.\n\"Yet Rafi, knowing that it's going to be an incredibly painful couple of hours, walks into the bath and bandage room ... so that we can clean her wounds to make sure they don't get infected and to prevent a potentially life-threatening situation.\n\"She's the bravest person I know.\"\nIn addition to the painful blisters, Rafi needs frequent throat surgeries, because her condition also affects mucous membranes. She often uses a wheelchair because it's so painful to walk.\n\"My daughter would love to be able to not have to wear bandages on a daily basis, she'd love to jump in a pool without worrying about it hurting, or taking a shower — or even wearing shoes.\"\nThe skin therapy described in the Nature paper wouldn't cure her — in fact, it targets a different genetic defect that causes the same condition. But a similar approach could reduce the agony of daily living. And Kopelan says medical interest in this disease is now growing rapidly.\n\"We've gone from zero biotechnology and pharmaceutical [companies] to like 12 companies, so we're really at an inflection point right now,\" he says.\nExperimental treatments are getting under way in the United States and Asia, as well as in Europe. Peter Marinkovich, Jean Tang and colleagues at the Stanford University School of Medicine are using the same approach as De Luca, and they have treated seven children using smaller patches of skin.\nMarinkovich tells Shots that their long-term goal is to treat a child's entire body, and the research is gradually laying the groundwork to do that. The severely injured child in Germany offered a unique opportunity to try that, and the encouraging results are generating more enthusiasm. \"I was super impressed when I saw [the] results,\" Marinkovich says.\nYou can reach Richard Harris at rharris@npr.org.","extracted_keywords":["skin","boy","gene","cells","disease","children","body","therapy","colleagues","child"]}

You think about the worst-case scenario.\"\nALD is a genetic brain disorder depicted in the 1992 movie Lorenzo's Oil, which portrayed a couple whose son became debilitated by the disease. The most serious form of the illness typically strikes boys between the ages of 4 and 10. Most are diagnosed too late for treatment to be successful, and they often die before their 10th birthday.\nThe more De Nies learned about ALD, the more she realized how fortunate the family was to have discovered Gregory's condition so early. Her son's blood was tested when he was about 10 months old.\nDr. Florian Eichler, a neurologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, says newborn screening is a game changer for children with the ALD, because it allows doctors to keep a close eye on kids who test positive for an ALD mutation from the beginning.\nGregory — who doesn't have any symptoms — will get his first brain MRI when he turns 2, and again every six months after he turns 3. If a scan shows changes that indicate he has the serious form of the disease, he'll likely then get a bone marrow transplant. That can stop ALD in its tracks.\n\"If you pick it up in the early stages,\" Eichler says, \"you are at a much better place in terms of treating it effectively.\"\nCalifornia is one of only a handful of states nationwide that now routinely screen newborn infants for the disease — a test that dramatically increases Gregory's chances of survival.\nThe state began testing newborns for ALD in September 2016 — seven months after the federal government added it to the list of recommended screenings. The testing in California included all babies born after February of that year.\nEichler says he has seen many families over the years whose boys were diagnosed late.\n\"Listening to families and their ordeal gives you a real sense of what this has done over generations and how much suffering could be prevented through the screening program,\" he says.\nNew York was the first to begin routine screening, in 2013, followed last year by Connecticut and California. A few other states, including Pennsylvania and Minnesota have since followed.\n\"It's mind-boggling that not every state is testing,\" says De Nies, who teaches children's ballet in San Diego. \"Families will not know until it could be too late for them.\"\nAdvocates, including several grieving moms who lost their sons to the disease, were instrumental in getting the screening law passed in California. Now they are continuing to lobby legislators and pushing health officials to add ALD to screening panels across the nation.\nJanis Sherwood says that since her son Sawyer's death from ALD in 2003, she has felt an urgency to educate doctors, families and others about the disease.\nBy the time she found out he was sick, she was helpless. He lost his sight, then his hearing, then his ability to talk and walk.\n\"I mean you don't prepare for that,\" she says, \"especially when they say there is nothing that could be done. Take him home and make him comfortable.\"\nIn the last few years, she has turned her attention to lobbying states throughout the nation to adopt newborn genetic screening for ALD. She believes that as California collects data on how the boys do in treatment, other states will follow. \"I think that we are going to see a domino effect as we get more states on board,\" she says.\nAbout one in every 18,000 people have ALD. Of boys with the genetic defect, about 30 to 40 percent will develop the life-threatening form of the disease, which leads to vision, gait and memory problems — and eventually death. The illness destroys myelin, the protective surface that surrounds the brain's nerve cells.\nBoth boys and girls get tested for ALD because they can both be carriers of the genetic defect and develop a less serious adult form of the disease. Only boys, however, develop the more serious, ultimately fatal, childhood version of the disease.\nThe common treatment, a bone marrow transplant, is risky and complicated, says Dr. Raman Sankar, a UCLA neurologist, but it is often successful if the donor is a good match and the procedure is performed before the child develops clinical symptoms.\nThe earlier the transplant, the better a boy's chance of survival, Sankar says. \"The delay may make the difference between whether he can have a life-saving treatment or not.\"\nDoctors are also having some success with gene therapy, in which the children undergo a transplant with their own stem cells rather than a donor's, Sankar says. In fact, a study published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine concluded that gene therapy \"may be a safe and effective alternative\" for treating boys with cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy. The study was based on 17 children with ALD, 15 of whom were doing well two years after gene therapy treatment.\nThe ALD screening test is part of a panel of tests done on blood samples drawn soon after a baby is born. (In California, state law requires that the blood be tested for about 80 diseases, including cystic fibrosis, severe combined immunodeficiency and primary congenital hypothyroidism).\nTypically around the nation, newborn testing kits cost a hospital or birthing facility about $120, says Dr. Jeff Botkin, chief of medical ethics at the University of Utah. \"This is an extraordinarily low cost for this number of tests,\" he says. The tests are typically covered by insurers or Medicaid.\nThere is no answer to the question of how common a condition should be to merit spending health care dollars on testing for it, Botkin says. But many of the conditions for which the federal government recommends screening are rare, which means they could affect 1 in 50,000 babies or fewer.\n\"The major question is whether the condition is treatable,\" Botkin says.\nBefore newborn screening, boys in the early stages of ALD frequently were incorrectly diagnosed with hyperactivity and other conditions, says Dr. Richard Olney, who heads the genetic disease screening program for the California Department of Public Health.\n\"Many families had to go through sort of a diagnostic odyssey,\" he says. \"It only became clear as they developed progressively worse problems that they had a serious genetic condition.\"\nBy the time a brain MRI was performed, there was often too much damage to save the child.\nEichler says that's part of the challenge for clinicians who may not be familiar with ALD: \"How do you know when this is a critical brain disease versus just a normal part of development?\"\nPeople with the genetic mutation who do not develop the disease in childhood may still have a milder form as adults. Boys and men who have the mutation need to be monitored by an endocrinologist, doctors say, because many will develop a condition in which their adrenal glands fail to produce enough of a stress hormone that is needed to fight infections.\nGina Cousineau's son Evan was diagnosed with ALD at age 8 in May 2007, after he came home from swim practice and had a seizure. Though he underwent a bone marrow transplant, Evan died from a secondary infection before he turned 9.\nCousineau lives in San Clemente, Calif., and helped lobby for the California law that requires ALD screening. She says newborn testing has benefits for infants with ALD and can help families discover that siblings or other relatives have the gene mutation.\n\"Thank God this newborn screening came into effect,\" Cousineau says. \"Knowledge is power. Had I had the knowledge with my son, Evan, he would be alive today.\"\nDe Nies says she worries about Gregory's future, but she's confident her son will live a long life. And she's grateful to Cousineau and other mothers whose sons didn't have the same chance.\n\"Without them, we would never know about the gene mutation,\" she says. \"I just feel like they are our fairy godmothers.\"\nSo far, five states test newborns for ALD. And at least half a dozen others are expected to begin screening soon.","extracted_keywords":["disease","screening","boys","son","brain","states","families","form","treatment","condition"]}

{"url":"https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2021/02/sport/tiger-woods-golf-career-moments-spt-intl-cmd/","title":"Tiger's trek: The making of golf's greatest ever player","extracted_core_text":"A Tiger’s trek\nThe life and times of golf’s biggest star\n“Golf is the closest game to the game we call life,” Bobby Jones -- the only man to win golf’s four major tournaments in one year -- once said. “You get bad breaks from good shots; you get good breaks from bad shots, but you have to play the ball where it lies.”\nIt seems an apt quote to sum up the man who is arguably the greatest golfer in the history of the game: Tiger Woods. From his storming debut and the “Tiger Slam” to the lows of scandal and personal tragedy and back to golf’s pinnacle with one of the legendary comebacks in sport, Woods is a figure who has seen and lived through it all. Honoring his tally of major titles to date, CNN looks at 15 moments that have defined the career of one of the world’s greatest athletes.\n-\n-\n1995\n-\nTiger cub\nAfter winning multiple tournaments as a junior, a much-talked-about Eldrick “Tiger” Woods made his first major appearance aged 19 at the Masters in 1995. He went on to finish tied-41st but showed glimpses of the player he was destined to become.\n-\n-\n1996\n-\nTurning professional\nWoods joined the PGA Tour in 1996 at the age of 20. He went on to be named Rookie of the Year after winning two tournaments and finishing in the top 10 three times in just eight starts.\n-\n-\n1997\n-\nMaiden major win\nThe American showed his true potential during his first full year on the PGA Tour, winning his maiden major title and becoming world No. 1 for the first time. His victory at The Masters was even more special given he won by a record 12 strokes. He finished as PGA Player of the Year and competed in his first Ryder Cup.\n-\n-\n2000\n-\nThe “Tiger Slam”\nWoods ended the season having broken or tied 27 PGA Tour records and winning three consecutive majors. At the age of 24, he had completed a career grand slam by adding the US Open and the Open Championship to his trophy cabinet, winning the former by a record 15 strokes. A year later, he completed the “Tiger Slam,” holding all four major titles at the same time.\n-\n-\n2002\n-\nPrize money rolls in\nHaving signed a new bumper sponsorship deal with Nike the previous year, Woods continued to excel on the course. He finished the year having won the most prize money on the PGA Tour and was PGA Player of the Year for the fifth time in six years.\n-\n-\n2006\n-\nFather’s death\nHaving reached the tally of 10 major victories, 2006 was a real test for Tiger. His father Earl died in May at the age of 74, but Woods was able to use it as motivation to win two highly emotional major titles at the PGA Championship and the Open Championship.\n-\n-\n2008\n-\nKnee injury\nAfter his remarkable 2008 US Open title win and pulling within four of Jack Nicklaus’ major record, Woods looked set to break the “Golden Bear’s” mark. However, a knee operation sidelined Tiger for two months and stunted his astronomic course -- a sign of the injury problems that were to later plague his career.\n-\n-\n2009\n-\nPersonal problems\nFollowing tabloid rumors of an extramarital affair, news of a car collision with a tree and fire hydrant yards from Woods' Florida home broke days later. Tiger announced in December 2009 that he would be taking a break from the game of golf. Two months later, Woods released a statement admitting his “transgressions\" -- after which numerous sponsors cut ties with him -- before an infamous press conference at the PGA Tour headquarters in Florida. \"I was unfaithful. I had affairs. I cheated,\" he told the world’s media with his mother Kultida sitting in the front row. Despite attempts to patch up his marriage, divorce from Elin followed later that year.\n-\n-\n2010\n-\nA downward spiral\nHaving returned to competition in April at the 2010 Masters, where he finished tied for fourth place, Woods struggled to regain his dominant form. He withdrew from the Players Championship citing injury and shortly afterwards, Hank Haney -- Woods' coach since 2003 -- resigned. After hiring Sean Foley, the rest of the season went poorly and Tiger failed to win a tournament in a season for the first time in his pro career.\n-\n-\n2013\n-\nGlimpses of his best\nPersistent injury niggles and swing changes hampered Woods, causing a tumble down the golf rankings. After a fruitful 2012 in which he moved to second on the all-time list of PGA Tour victories behind Sam Snead, 2013 signalled the return of dominant Tiger. He won five events, as well as finishing in the top five three other times, to move back to world No. 1.\n-\n-\n2014-17\n-\nStruggles\nHowever, at the moment he looked to have recaptured his best form, Woods was hit by serious injury problems. Four back operations, including spinal fusion surgery, led to \"dark times,\" where the pain was so bad he couldn't even get out of bed or play with his kids. There were aborted comebacks, a leaked clip from a Masters Champions Dinner where Woods admitted his career was \"done\" and his world ranking plunged outside the top 1,100. An arrest on a DUI charge and an addiction to painkillers used to treat his back followed and had many questioning whether this was the end for the golfing great.\n-\n-\n2018-19\n-\nThe comeback\nAgainst all odds, clips of Woods practicing trickled through social media in 2018, igniting speculation about a potential comeback. The old shots were finding their mark as Woods pushed Brooks Koepka to the wire at the 2018 PGA Championship. The scenes of a stampeding mass following Woods as he strode to victory in the season-ending Tour Championship were the stuff of Hollywood blockbusters. But the culmination of one of sport’s greatest ever comebacks was finally complete at the 2019 Masters as Woods clinched a fifth Green Jacket and a 15th major title -- his first for 11 years.\n-\n-\n2020\n-\nLike father, like son\nAt the PNC Championship in December, Team Woods stole the show as both Tiger and his son Charlie took to the course, captivating fans in matching red shirts. The father and son team -- who finished seventh among a 20-team field -- went back home with \"memories we'll have for our entire lives.\" After feeling discomfort during the tournament, Woods underwent the fifth back surgery of his career.\n-\n-\n2021\n-\nFebruary\nThe crash\nShortly after 7 a.m. PT in Rancho Palos Verdes, near Los Angeles, Woods was driving when his SUV crossed a median, went across two lanes of road before hitting a curb, hitting a tree and landing on its side off the roadway in the brush. No other vehicles were involved. A Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy, who was first on the scene, said Woods was lucid and calm, wearing his seatbelt and able to tell him his name was Tiger.\n-\nFebruary\nInjuries\nUsing a pry bar and ax, the 15-time major champion was removed from the vehicle with the aid of a backboard, neck collar and leg splints. Taken by ambulance to the Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, he arrived in a serious but stable condition and underwent surgery on his injured legs.\n-\n-","extracted_keywords":["golf","year","career","time","world","injury","times","game","season","tournaments"]}

The Oscar Academy’s lack of support for Hamdan Ballal sparked outrage among its own members and it had to publicly apologize for its inaction.\nWe are ashamed of such passivity.\nWhy is it that cinema, a breeding ground for socially committed works, seems to be so indifferent to the horror of reality and the oppression suffered by our sisters and brothers?\nAs artists and cultural players, we cannot remain silent while genocide is taking place in Gaza and this unspeakable news is hitting our communities hard.\nWhat is the point of our professions if not to draw lessons from history, to make films that are committed, if we are not present to protect oppressed voices?\nWhy this silence?\nThe far right, fascism, colonialism, anti-trans and anti-LGBTQIA+, sexist, racist, islamophobic and antisemitic movements are waging their battle on the battlefield of ideas, attacking publishing, cinema and universities, and that’s why we have a duty to fight.\nLet’s refuse to let our art be an accomplice to the worst.\nLet us rise up.\nLet us name reality.\nLet us collectively dare to look at it with the precision of our sensitive hearts, so that it can no longer be silenced and covered up.\nLet us reject the propaganda that constantly colonizes our imaginations and makes us lose our sense of humanity.\nFor Fatma, for all those who die in indifference.\nCinema has a duty to carry

{"url":"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/alejandro-agresti-malaga-festival-latido-films-1236342315/","title":"Alejandro Agresti's 'What We Wanted to Be' Explores  Lives of Pretense","extracted_core_text":"Argentine director Alejandro Agresti (“The Lake House”) returns to the big screen with “Lo Que Quisimos Ser” (“What We Wanted to Be”), a touching story of two people who develop a unique relationship yet continue to long for more.\nPremiering out of competition at the Malaga Film Festival, the film, set in 1998, follows a man and a woman (Luis Rubio and Eleonora Wexler) who meet for the first time outside a movie theater in Buenos Aires, where they were the only people in the audience to see Howard Hawks’ 1940 classic “His Girl Friday,” starring Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell.\nThey decide to go for a drink and, at her request, make up new identities for themselves, becoming who they always wanted to be: she is Irene, a romantic novelist; he is Yuri, an adventurous astronaut who grew up in Africa. Hitting it off, they decide to meet every Thursday at the same place and carry on their fantasy lives. In the process, they grow ever closer, as does reality.\nPopular on Variety\nDiscussing his film with Variety, Agresti said, “Part of the inspiration comes from observing and reflecting on a certain ‘new’ way of relating through social media. How can we construct our own image and past at will, pretending to be what we are not, replacing it with what we would like or perceive ourselves to be.”\nIndeed, Agresti says he chose to set the film in 1998 “precisely to distance myself from the current invasion of social media. To engage in the game the story proposes face to face between two people.”\nThe film, which also pays tribute to Hollywood classics of yesteryear, offers an exploration of social pretense and performance in the real world.\n“As Irene reflects in the film, we are all, to a certain extent, actors, behind the curtain of the social scene in which we live. A game that contains its innocent side, but can also end up damaging us, making us lose all sense of ourselves, even narcissistically imposing on others that they become mirrors of our whims.”\nWhile the story touches on themes like coming to terms with life choices, regrets and the brevity of life, Agresti says he only explored those aspects “to the extent the story allowed, without using tricks or narrative paraphernalia; maintaining the simplicity and humanity of these two characters.”\nIn embodying those characters, Wexler and Rubio possessed the ideal qualities, Agresti notes.\n“Eleonora handles her face like few actresses I’ve worked with. She’s able to transform it into the most diverse landscapes without the need for technical elaboration, with that purity, honesty, and subtle handling of each gesture.\n“As for Luis Rubio, I wrote the script with him in mind, although without knowing him personally. I had seen him in roles that were completely different from this one. He’s originally a comedian, but beyond that quality, I could sense a vulnerable, endearing person, capable of playing any role.\n“They are two formidable actors of substance.”\nProduced by Gastón Duprat, Fernando Sokolowicz and Analía Perez, “What We Wanted to Be” is sold internationally by Madrid-based Latido Films.","extracted_keywords":["film","story","people","face","media","game","extent","actors","life","characters"]}

Said (pictured above, left) is a Mexican citizen but a legal permanent resident of the United States and holder of a green card, according to the post.\n“We are heartbroken to announce we have to cancel our upcoming European tour,” the band wrote. “Our drummer, Yamal Said, who is a Mexican citizen and lawful permanent resident of the United States (green card holder) was forcibly removed from our flight to Europe by Customs and Border Patrol at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport on Monday May 12.

At Sundance, Berlin and Toronto, the movie business seemed to be in the throes of a massive contraction. Having spent freely while launching their own in-house challengers to Netflix, studios like Warner Bros., Disney and Paramount, along with their indie brethren, were in full-on cost-cutting mode. Complicating matters was the fact that after being burned by overspending for projects and packages at festivals in the past, tech giants like Apple and Amazon have instead concentrated on producing in-house content. That left many filmmakers still searching for distribution long after the crowds dispersed.\nBut there’s something about the sunshine — or maybe the free-flowing rosé — in the South of France that always leads to a bidding war or two. Here’s a look at 15 projects that have buyers buzzing and that maybe, just maybe, could have Hollywood spending like it’s 2019 again.\nPopular on Variety\n“Bunker”\nCast: Javier Bardem, Penélope Cruz\nDirector: Florian Zeller\nAgency: CAA, WME Independent, FilmNation (International)\nWhy Buyers Care: Zeller, the director of the Oscar-winning “The Father” and an acclaimed playwright, returns to the screen with this thriller about an architect tapped to construct a survivalist bunker for a tech billionaire. It all sounds very on point given how much the wackier branch of the one percent has been in the headlines of late. (We may or may not be referencing a certain godfather of all things DOGE). Throw in real-life married couple Bardem and Cruz, who are usually electrifying when paired on film, and you have all the ingredients for something special.\n“Urchin”\nCast: Frank Dillane, Megan Northam\nDirector: Harris Dickinson\nAgency: Charades\nWhy Buyers Care: Dickinson shows a different side of himself, making his feature directorial debut with this story of a drifter trying to reintegrate into society. This film makes its debut in Cannes’ Un Certain Regard section and — sight unseen — the early buzz is strong, with Dickinson apparently delivering a compelling portrait of how the system fails people dealing with mental health issues.\n“Ruin”\nCast: Gal Gadot, Matthias Schoenaerts\nDirector: Niki Caro\nAgency: UTA Independent Film Group, WME Independent, CAA Media Finance, The Veterans (International)\nWhy Buyers Care: As “Mulan” proved, Caro can stage a historical set piece with the best of them. And she has an evocative backdrop with “Ruin,” which takes place in the aftermath of World War II and follows a recently released camp prisoner (Gadot) who teams up with a German soldier (Schoenaerts) to exact revenge on a Nazi SS squad.\n“Alma”\nCast: Pamela Anderson, Dakota Fanning, Lindsay Duncan\nDirector: Sally Potter\nAgency: Bankside\nWhy Buyers Care: The “Pamissance” continues. Anderson, fresh off her buzzy turn in “The Last Showgirl,” leads an ensemble that includes Fanning and Duncan in this story of a family who reunite to scatter the ashes of their mother. Instead of a nice send off and a few shared remembrances, they are left to deal with her continued haunting presence. Potter, who made arthouse classics like “Orlando,” has a particular knack for spinning these kind of offbeat yarns.\n“The Invite”\nCast: Olivia Wilde, Seth Rogen, Penélope Cruz, Edward Norton\nDirector: Olivia Wilde\nAgency: FilmNation, UTA Independent Film Group\nWhy Buyers Care: Wilde has an enviable track record behind the camera, having directed the critically adored “Booksmart” and the commercially successful head-spinner “Don’t Worry Darling.” This relationship comedy sounds like an envelope pusher (in a good way), telling the story of a couple whose “get to know you” with the neighbors also unearths some deeply repressed feelings and unexplored sexuality. It will be interesting how a comic genius like Rogen plays off Norton and Cruz, who, though award-winning thespians, have shown they know how to deliver a punch line in films like “Birdman” and “Vicky Cristina Barcelona.”\n“The Six Billion Dollar Man”\nDirector: Eugene Jarecki\nAgency: WME Independent\nWhy Buyers Care: Jarecki is no stranger to hot-button issues and controversial figures, having previously tackled everything from the War on Drugs to the military industrial complex to Henry Kissinger. With his latest documentary, “The Six Billion Dollar Man,” Jarecki examines Julian Assange and the debate around press freedom that the Wikileaks founder kicked off. The film, which should spark fierce debate when it screens at Cannes, boasts never before-seen archival footage. It debuts roughly a year after Assange reached a plea deal and was released from prison in the U.K.\n“Strange Arrivals”\nCast: Colman Domingo, Demi Moore\nDirector: Roger Ross Williams\nAgency: WME Independent, CAA Media Finance, Rocket Science (International)\nWhy Buyers Care: Oscar-winning director Williams teams up with Moore and Domingo, who were fellow Academy Award nominees this year for their work in “The Substance” and “Sing Sing,” to tell the true story of Betty and Barney Hill, an interracial couple who, in 1961, became the first reported case of an alien abduction. It’s based on a podcast of the same name by Toby Ball and boasts a script by Jane Anderson, best known for adapting “Olive Kitteridge” into an Emmy-winning HBO miniseries.\n“The Accompanist”\nDirector: Zach Woods\nCast: Susan Sarandon, Everly Carganilla, Aubrey Plaza\nAgency: CAA Media Finance, Gersh, Mister Smith (International)\nWhy Buyers Care: Woods, best known for his comedic work on “Silicon Valley” and “The Office,” makes his feature directorial debut with the story of a 9-year-old (Carganilla) who gets placed with a funny and unpredictable foster parent (Sarandon) is dealing with ghosts from her past. The unusual premise — who doesn’t love some magical realism — and top-shelf cast should perk interest.\n“Séance on a Wet Afternoon ”\nCast: Rachel Weisz\nDirector: Tomas Alfredson\nAgency: UTA Independent Film Group, CAA Media Finance, FilmNation (International)\nWhy Buyers Care: Alfredson, who flexed his talent for spinning atmospheric tension with “Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy,” remakes this 1964 British crime thriller about a medium, who dupes her husband into kidnapping the son of a wealthy family so she help the police “find” the kid and prove her psychic abilities are the real McCoy. Weisz has the showy lead role (Kim Stanley, who played the same part decades ago, got an Oscar nomination for her efforts).\n“She Gets It From Me”\nCast: Rachel Zegler, Marisa Tomei\nDirector: Julia von Heinz\nAgency: CAA Media Finance, Embankment (International)\nWhy Buyers Care: Zegler, of “West Side Story” and “Snow White” fame, and Tomei, the Oscar-winning star of “My Cousin Vinny” and “Spider-Man: No Way Home,” will share the screen in this unconventional family story about a woman whose engagement celebration kicks off a search to find her pill-popping, ex-punk rocker birth mother. It sounds like a heartwarming, potentially hilarious and female-forward take on “Flirting With Disaster.”\n“Photograph 51”\nCast: Natalie Portman\nDirector: Tom Hooper\nAgency: CAA Media Finance, FilmNation (International)\nWhy Buyers Care: Hooper, the Oscar-winning director of “The King’s Speech,” will try to regain his footing after “Cats” with this true story of Rosalind Franklin, a brilliant scientist whose work in x-ray crystallography gave Watson and Crick a leg up by capturing an image that revealed DNA’s double-helix structure. It sounds like a meaty role for Portman, as well as the kind of CGI-feline-free project that can remind audiences of Hooper’s undeniable talent for telling more grounded stories.\n“Nouvelle Vague“\nCast: Guillaume Marbeck, Zoey Deutch, Aubry Dullin\nDirector: Richard Linklater\nAgency: Goodfellas\nWhy Buyers Care: The story behind the story that transformed cinema. Linklater, an icon of indies, pulls back the curtain on Jean-Luc Godard, one of progenitors of the French New Wave, and the making of “Breathless.” It sounds like catnip for movie lovers. Deutch is supposed to burn up the screen as Jean Seberg, the American film star whose fascinating off-screen life (she was a target of J. Edgar Hoover’s COINTELPRO and a passionate supporter of the Black Panther Party) probably deserves a mini-series of its own.\n“Anxious People“\nCast: Angelina Jolie\nDirector: Marc Forster\nAgency: WME Independent, Black Bear (International)\nWhy Buyers Care: Forster, who recently helmed the surprise box office hit “A Man Called Otto,” returns with this story of an investment banker who finds herself taken hostage with a reluctant bank robber during an open house. Jolie earned some of the best reviews of her career playing Maria Callas in last year’s “Maria,” reminding viewers what they’d been missing after her self-imposed break from films.\n“The Painted Bride“\nCast: Jeremy Allen White, Isabella Rossellini, Mandy Patinkin\nDirector: Jeremiah Zagar\nAgency: WME Independent, Charades/New Europe (International)\nWhy Buyers Care: White, soon to star as Bruce Springsteen in the biopic “Deliver Me From Nowhere,” is trying to leverage his breakout role as a stressed out chef in “The Bear” into movie stardom. Freed from the kitchen, “The Painted Bride” finds White playing a man obsessing over a new project dedicated to his young son and dying father. Zagar won raves for “We Are Animals,” a coming-of-age drama that was a favorite at the 2018 edition of Sundance, and also oversaw the Adam Sandler film, “Hustle.”\n“Shutout”\nCast: Robert De Niro, Jenna Ortega\nDirector: David O. Russell\nAgency: CAA Media Finance, Black Bear (International)\nWhy Buyers Care: Russell’s last outing didn’t go so well — that would be 2022’s high-profile flop, “Amsterdam.” But most of the director’s previous collaborations with De Niro, such as “Silver Linings Playbook” and “Joy,” have been winners. It also helps that Ortega, who has built an impressive fanbase thanks to her work on Netflix’s “Wednesday,” is a legitimate draw. Here’s hoping the two actors can help Russell recapture his touch with this story of a pool hustler and his prodigy. At the very least, “Shutout” will be interesting.","extracted_keywords":["buyers","story","film","director","screen","year","work","star","movie","house"]}

The idea of James holding the reins to tell this story got me extremely excited to tackle this world with him. We sat down in my backyard and spoke for hours about the love of filmmaking.

{"url":"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/clown-in-a-cornfield-twist-explained-author-adam-cesare-1236396086/","title":"'Clown in a Cornfield' Twist Explained by Author Adam Cesare","extracted_core_text":"SPOILER ALERT: This story spoils all the twists and turns of “Clown in a Cornfield,” so be warned!\n“Clown in a Cornfield” is a certified indie hit, earning IFC’s biggest opening weekend to date. Based on the hit YA horror book, what differentiates the film from other slashers is a mid-movie twist that flips the rules on their head.\nThe twist? The haunting Frendo the Clown, which had been previously glimpsed dispatching teens in a potentially supernatural manner, descends on a farmhouse party filled with drunk teens. But after one gory death gets the revelers’ attention, not one Frendo emerges from the cornfield, but a whole mob of bloodthirsty killer clowns start running out at once.\nPopular on Variety\nIt was an indelible image for horror fans this year, and led to a compelling reveal, with all the adults planning to kill the kids of the town for rejecting tradition. It’s a twist that demands deeper analysis, as director Eli Craig and Adam Cesare, the author of the “Clown in a Cornfield” series, discussed in a recent Variety feature.\nBut now that the movie is out and being discussed, Cesare sat down with Variety once more to break down the twists in his book that made it into the big screen adaptation.\nThe movie’s biggest “Oh shit!” moment is when a bunch of Frendos come running out of the cornfield at the party. Was that always a twist you envisioned from the start?\nYes. It became such a battle — the motivations and idea of “Well, they can’t kill their own kids!” Not that I had any kind of contentious relationship with Harper editorial or anything. I love my editor over there. But really early that was the main creative discussion we were having on the book. “Can you kill this many children and have the culprits partly be the parents of the kids?” It’s getting hazy now because it was six or seven years ago, but I just remember so many phone calls walking around my small Philadelphia apartment on speakerphone and, we had a lot of neighbors too and some very religious neighbors, as I’m saying, “Yes, they can kill their own kids! Believe me, it’ll be great!” [Laughs]\nThis is a theme with publishing in general, especially in children’s publishing: Horror fans have fairly specific interests. Things that you can pitch will go over with the horror crowd that won’t go over with non-horror people. Especially in Book 3, there’s just a lot of stuff where I’m like, “I know this will work. Trust me. This is my life. I love this stuff more than anything.” Not to make it a casual versus elite fans kind of thing, but if you talk to non-horror people when you’re a horror person, you’ll get looks. I completely understand it, as someone who’s in a relationship with someone who’s not a horror person. Non-horror people can kind of pull you back to be like, “Oh, that’s an absurd thing,” or “That is a disgusting thing,” or “That is a taboo thing.” You’re like, “Oh yeah. I’m just so in it all the time with this stuff that I don’t even really mark it that way.”\nEven before the movie, did you get a lot of feedback on the twist ending when you were talking with readers?\nThe funny thing was there was so much upfront discussion internally on HarperCollins’ part, and it wasn’t just my editor. I think it was just generally like, “What are we doing here?” Then, when the reviews came out and people started reading the book, it was well-liked by not only its target audience of younger horror fans, but with older horror fans too, and non-horror fans. I hear a lot from teachers and librarians and parents that “This got my kid into reading,” or “This got my kid into reading horror,” or a lot of spouses are giving the book to their non-horror people, so it’s this gateway horror thing. But it does have this certain viciousness to it, where it was such a long discussion about, “Can Cole’s dad really try to kill his own son? Can this plot be the plot?” Then you look at the reviews and reaction to it, and not no one, but not a statistically significant amount of people were thrown by it. I think anyone who’s been a parent or been a teacher … they get it.\nThere was speculation online that the film might change the source material and Frendo would be supernatural. Were there ever any discussions about that?\nWe’re going back a little while now, because Carter Blanchard’s first script had several key differences from the book. Carter’s a wonderful writer, and I love his work, but there was some hesitancy on my part. There were a couple of things in there I really would like to sneak back in from the book because I think they’re good ideas. But I’m not a big “rock the boat” guy, and as far as adaptation goes, I’m a proponent of filmmakers should be filmmakers and authors should be authors, and I’m cool with derivations and deviations from the story. But independently of me, Eli was hooked from the script, and I think it was that central twist, the multiple Frendos, that hooked him. And he’s like, ‘Yeah, there’s something here,’ which was in Carter’s script. And then he read the book — I’m not talking out of school, he’s said this in interviews — and said, “Let’s pull a bunch of stuff back from the book,” to which I said, “I think you’re right, but who am I to say, because I’m kind of biased.”\nBut there was never any … I do some real wacky stuff in the sequels, but for the adaptation of book one, there was never any discussion of “Should he be Michael Myers?” “Should he be Pennywise?” “Should he be Art?” There was a clear, almost creative decision of, “You can’t be those things when we have to be the thing that we have, and this is what it is.” It’s almost like a very stripped-back, whodunit slasher. It doesn’t have the accrual of franchise and too much genre expectation or genre knowledge on it, which I think is what makes the movie great. To try indulge in the speculation of “It’s Pennywise meets ‘Children of the Corn'” … that’s just pure rope-a-dope to get you in the theater or to get you pissed off in the comments section. It’s as close to trolling that a company like HarperCollins is gonna get.\nAnother late reveal in the movie is that two male characters, Rust and Cole, have a romantic history. How did you want to address that in the book versus how it is shown in the movie?\nWriting it in the book I made it so much harder on myself than I had to. I look at the way Eli does it in the film — he doesn’t have the benefit of internal monologue and all these different things, where you’re setting a lot of these characters up as red herrings. Cole and Rust, for the first half of the film and the book, are the prime suspects. I think Eli does an amazing job … there’s something so elegant about how he does it without the benefit of the guide rails I had in the book. In the book, the reveal comes a lot later, at the very end is the CPR kiss. Because we’re so close with Quinn’s POV, at first, she thinks that Rust is doing CPR on Cole. It’s this moment, after all this bloody stuff, where you have a moment to breathe. Then they’re kissing, and she’s so taken aback. But it’s supposed to be like, in the film, the idea that everything kind of clicks and makes sense once you have this context.\nI’ve said this in Q&As where people have just seen the movie, but it’s the one thing from the movie that I would actually entertain George Lucas’ing my own book and going back to how it’s revealed in the movie, when they’re all in the shed. It’s so smart and it gives them a bit more time to be a couple and to feel the stakes when Rust might die. It’s the one structural thing where I’m like, “Oh, that’s different from my book, but if I had a time machine, I would have Cole and Rust be revealed as a couple earlier.” But I also have the luxury of it being books and knowing while I was writing the first book that I was going to get to write a sequel. So I knew you could delay that, because if you like those characters and if you like that arc, that arc’s gonna continue.","extracted_keywords":["book","horror","movie","thing","lot","people","twist","fans","stuff","film"]}
{"url":"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/catalonia-at-cannes-romeria-sirat-1236397934/","title":"Catalonia's Historic Cannes Presence Headlined by 'Romería,' 'Sirat'","extracted_core_text":"For the first time in history, two films from Catalan producers, Carla Simón’s “Romería” and Oliver Laxe’s “Sirat,” have secured coveted spots in the main competition at Cannes.\nThis milestone signals the fruition of years of strategic investment, education and international collaboration that has transformed Catalonia into an emerging force of European auteur cinema.\n“It’s wonderful that things like this are happening, but it’s not by chance,” says Oriol Maymó, the Catalan producer of “Sirat” at Corte y Confección. “This is the result of an industry that’s been working with passion for many years, from institutions like ICEC [Catalan Institute for the Cultural Companies] to audiovisual training centers like ESCAC and Pompeu Fabra. Year after year, these schools produce highly skilled technicians and artists.”\nIndeed, education and institutional support form the backbone of Catalonia’s cinematic surge. Executive producer Sandra Tapia points out, “First, you need talent. Then, you need opportunities for training. Here, both public universities and film schools have been trusted for years to develop that talent.” The Catalan government, via ICEC, has played a pivotal role by not only financing productions but also promoting Catalan cinema internationally through Catalan Films.\nPopular on Variety\nHowever, it’s not just creative nurturing that’s paying off. Catalonia’s embrace of international co-productions has opened doors to broader markets. Both “Romería” and “Sirat” are backed by significant European co-producers, making them highly attractive prospects for global audiences.\n“Romería” producer Maria Zamora highlights the long-term vision behind this shift, explaining, “This is the confirmation of a new generation of directors and producers who have spent years working on the international reach of our projects from the very beginning, co-producing with other countries.”\nZamora also emphasizes the cultural policies supporting young talent development: “Talent isn’t born on its own. It’s encouraged through very specific cultural policies aimed at supporting young talent and auteur cinema.”\nCommercially, the effects are already visible. Maymó notes, “I think Catalan films are becoming more marketable. Distributors and sales agents are paying closer attention because more projects are being made for wider audiences without losing their unique perspectives.”\nThe creative evolution is palpable in the films themselves. “Sirat,” co-written by Santiago Fillol and directed by Laxe, takes a gritty journey through Morocco’s rave culture, while “Romería” blends deeply personal memory with a universal search for identity. Though rooted in specific cultures, both films manage to resonate internationally. “Very strong and deep-rooted cultures like Catalan, Galician or Basque create highly particular and genuine local stories that, because of their truthfulness, become universal,” Zamora explains.\nSandra Tapia, an executive producer at Oscar-nominated Barcelona-based “Robot Dreams” production company Arcadia Motion Pictures, adds another crucial dimension: the role of public broadcasters. TV3, Catalonia’s regional television partner, has been instrumental in maintaining production momentum even as streaming platforms scale back commissions. “Having strong public TV is crucial,” Tapia asserts. “It ensures that when the market contracts, filmmakers still have vital support.”\nOf course, the success at Cannes also reflects the growing sophistication of Catalan producers in navigating international markets. “Younger producers like us are much more comfortable traveling to markets, pitching internationally and co-producing across countries,” Tapia says. However, she points out a lingering challenge: Spain still lacks the robust international distribution support that countries like France provide.\n“Public support often only kicks in once you’ve already succeeded at a major festival,” Tapia laments.\nYet the momentum is undeniable. Zamora describes it as a movement that has been building strength for years: “I remember when I started going to co-production forums 15 years ago, there were just two or three Spanish producers. Now, there are scores of young producers with projects everywhere.”\nCatalonia’s cosmopolitan nature has also made it uniquely adept at building cross-border partnerships. “Catalonia has been very open to supporting important and emerging auteurs,” Zamora notes. “It’s about more than just local projects – it’s about packaging important productions that can resonate internationally.”\nThe selection of “Romería” and “Sirat” at Cannes isn’t an outlier. It is a manifestation of a rich, deliberate evolution within Catalan cinema, one that values artistic ambition and commercial strategy equally. As Maymó puts it, “If we keep believing in our industry, investing in broad-audience projects without losing our personal voice, Catalonia’s presence at major festivals will not just continue, it will grow.”","extracted_keywords":["producers","years","talent","projects","films","producer","support","productions","markets","countries"]}

The film, shot in Brazil, dramatizes the real-life solo transatlantic row of Brazilian explorer Amyr Klink and stars Filipe Bragança, Felipe Camargo and Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu.\nGlobal Constellation will handle international sales for “100 Days.” The project has attracted attention for its ambitious production scope and multinational collaboration, including Brazil’s Ventre Studio (“Godless John”), Boipeba, Madremidia, O2 Filmes (“City of God”), Total Post and Disney Group, as well as Finland’s well-connected Good Hand Production.\n“Directing my first live-action feature in Brazil was a crash course in creativity, grit, and human connection,” said Saldanha in a statement. “The Brazilian crew’s passion and resourcefulness, paired with the cast’s talent and generosity, turned impossible tasks into collective victories, like constructing a sprawling indoor water tank in a warehouse in São Paulo or battling the open sea’s chaos with nothing but ingenuity and nerve. Every hurdle became a bonding moment, infused with the warmth of a big family reunion.”\nPopular on Variety\nThe film recounts the journey of Amyr Klink, who in 1984 became the first person to row across the Atlantic Ocean. The production navigated both logistical and environmental challenges to bring the story to life on screen.\nProducer Paula Cosenza highlighted the unique scope of the project. “We always saw the film as a potent story that could move people all over the world. ‘100 Days’ is not only the first Finland-Brazil co-production but a co-production within Brazil itself, with Ventre Studio, Boipeba, Madremidia, O2, Total Post, and Disney Group joining forces to make one of the most audacious productions of the year. In such a fantastic moment for Brazilian cinema, we are thrilled to entrust the film to Global Constellation’s super-experienced and exciting team.”\nProducer João Queiroz Filho added, “Adapting ‘100 Days’ from book to screen was both an honor and a challenge; it demanded logistical daring, precision, and unwavering commitment. Producing a film of this scale in Brazil meant confronting complexity at every turn, but always with the vision of delivering a cinematic experience as epic and human as Amyr’s journey itself.”\nAssociate producers Roosa Toivonen and Kemppinen of Finland’s Good Hand Production said, “For us, it is utterly inspiring to work with Carlos, Paula and their team on this wonderful film that truly and literally crosses continents.”\nFabien Westerhoff, Managing Director, Film Global Constellation added: “From ‘Rio’ to ‘Ferdinand’ to ‘Scrat,’ Carlos has created some of the most iconic family entertainment characters in recent history. We can’t wait for buyers to discover his newest adventure, embarking on an epic journey of survival across the sea. A visually stunning tale of a man overcoming an impossible athletic feat.”\nThe Finnish production house also brought in Totalpost Finland, a consortium that includes Energia VFX, James Post and Helea Sound Post Production.

Iggy Pop is a fan of her music, Akin said, and, like Pop in the 1970s, has found a creative refuge in the city.\n“She had to leave Turkey after she got in trouble about her lyrics in this very misogynist society that the country has become,” Akin explained. “In the last five or six years, almost a quarter-million Turkish people, educated people, have left Turkey — doctors, scientists, you know. There has been a huge brain drain.”\nPopular on Variety\nAkin, whose parents moved from Turkey to Germany in the 1960s, added: “I would like to make a portrait of this generation who are leaving the country, and she stands for that generation.”\n“Ghosts” is based on a screenplay by Ruth Toma and Akin is currently doing the rewrite. “It’s kind of a love story for the audience that watched ‘Rheingold,’” he said, referring to his 2022 gangster film. “That was a huge success in Germany, and we had this audience running into the multiplex. These were people of a certain background, mostly from the Middle East, who discovered the cinema with this film. And, it’s kind of like, ‘OK, if they like the gangster flick, what about if I give them a love story?’”\n“Amrum” is set in 1945 on the German island of Amrum, where 12-year-old Nanning — a refugee from his bomb-destroyed home in Hamburg — discovers a rural idyll. He learns to hunt, fish, dig for potatoes and gather honey, but gradually he also learns the truth about his parents, who are both devoted followers of Hitler, which will lead to his expulsion from this paradise.\nIn terms of the theme of the loss of innocence, Akin was influenced in part by reading John Milton’s poem “Paradise Lost,” but, cinematographically, he drew inspiration from Vittorio De Sica’s “Bicycle Thieves” and “Shoeshine,” and Rob Reiner’s “Stand by Me,” he said.\nThe film was based on the childhood memories of German filmmaker Hark Bohm, who wrote the original screenplay, which was then rewritten by Akin.\nOne of the elements that attracted Akin to Bohm’s story was the relationship between a child and their parents, when the parents have extreme political views. “You cannot choose your parents, so here you have this kid, and he loves his mother, and his mother is a Nazi, and there’s this mother, and she is a Nazi, and she loves the kid. I didn’t want to create empathy for Nazis — that was not my purpose at all — but I was like, ‘I have to define this love. I have to tell the story of the love between mother and child. If I don’t have that, I don’t have a movie.'”\nThe recent rise of the far right in Germany was one of the reasons why Akin took on the project, he said, with the far-right Alternative for Germany party rapidly gaining strength. “J.D. Vance can say what he wants, but it is an extreme-right party. If you have 10 million people who vote for them, it doesn’t mean you have to respect them or give them space, fuck that. Sooner or later, they touch your family or someone you know. So, we have to deal with that, and I think storytelling could help to reflect on that.”\nHe described ”Amrum” as a journey into the depths of his “German soul,” and said he is willing to fight to defend the values of his country, including freedom of expression. “There is an erasing of those values all around the world, and in Germany too, and I, not just as a filmmaker, but as a member of that society, have to defend my German soul.”","extracted_keywords":["parents","people","love","story","mother","country","film","documentary","ghosts","society"]}

{"url":"https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/promised-sky-review-promis-le-ciel-1236398617/","title":"'Promised Sky' Review: A Keenly Observed Migrant Drama","extracted_core_text":"Selected to open the Un Certain Regard section of the Cannes Film Festival, French Tunisian director Erige Sehiri’s intimately conceived drama “Promised Sky” follows four generations of Ivorian immigrant women as they find solidarity, conflict and sometimes a sense of displacement in one another’s company. Female relationships are complicated enough as is, even between those on a level playing field. But in “Promised Sky,” they are thornier since none of the women are equals from a socio-economic standpoint in their adopted home in Tunisia.\n“Promised Sky” starts on a note of matriarchal unity, not separation. Utilizing the same perceptive documentarian aesthetic at the heart of her previous feature, “Under the Fig Trees,” Sehiri drops the audience into the lives of Marie (Aïssa Maïga), Naney (Debora Lobe Naney) and Jolie (Laetitia Ky), as the three roommates care for a little girl in a bubble bath, gently washing her as they try to get to know her situation.\nPopular on Variety\nThe girl is Kenza (Estelle Kenza Dogbo), a displaced child who appears to have miraculously survived a migrant shipwreck before the three women found her. A former journalist now serving her community as a pastor after 10 years in Tunisia, Marie decides to open her home to Kenza like she did for Naney — a spirited undocumented mother who left her child at home three years ago with the hopes of finding a better future for her family in Tunisia — and Jolie, a passionate student and the only documented member of the group.\n“Promised Sky” loosely reflects real events, and feels visually and texturally truthful thanks to Sehiri’s authentic point of view and cinematographer Frida Marzouk’s poetic lens. The film often feels like a mazy tapestry of moods and situations, rather than a traditional narrative.\nSehiri doesn’t necessarily attempt to tell a neatly organized story revolving around the three women’s actions after Kenza abruptly joins their ranks. Instead, she lets the chaotic messiness of their lives unfold organically, through a casually observant disposition that feels untidy and random at times. Sehiri’s film adds up to something greater than the sum of its parts, becoming a unique drama about marginalized African immigrant women fighting for their dignity and place not in Europe (the usual setting for many similarly themed films), but on their own continent, Africa.\nFor Marie, that fight involves providing spiritual leadership to her community, praying for strength and perseverance, and preaching compassion and forgiveness, while distributing food and supplies to those in need. For Naney, the struggle is making ends meet by any means necessary — even if that might invite trouble — while hoping to bring her child to Tunisia one day. Elsewhere, Jolie is driven by different motivations, trusting her privileges as a documented resident in Tunisia. Soon enough, she learns that racism and prejudices in the country don’t spare her, regardless of what papers she possesses.\nThere are some male side players too, including Marie’s unsympathetic landlord Ismael (Mohamed Grayaâ), who takes advantage of Marie’s lack of options by refusing to make simple improvements in her modest housing. And then there is Naney’s Tunisian friend Foued (Foued Zaazaa), providing her with some much-needed (if deficient) camaraderie in both life’s random moments and special days like birthdays. Marie’s blind friend Noa (Touré Blamassi), who judges every situation with intelligent clarity and advises Marie accordingly, brings some gentle serenity to the story. (Sehiri leans too heavily into unsophisticated symbolism with Noa, coming dangerously close to characterizing a disability as if it’s a mystical feature.) Someone else who gets the short end of the stick is Kenza. After abruptly introducing the character, writers Sehiri, Anna Ciennik and Malika Cécile Louati sadly treat her like an afterthought; it almost feels as if they have struggled to find a real purpose for Kenza in the tale, missing an opportunity with a gifted child actor who will quietly break your heart with her final scene.\n“Promised Sky” is at its strongest when Sehiri approaches a neorealistic style in filming the happenstances of street life, dialing up her documentarian instincts. It also packs a punch when Sehiri underscores just how deeply rooted (and similar-sounding) anti-migrant sentiments are around the world. In one scene, for instance, we learn that some Tunisians spread false rumors that migrants eat domestic cats — it’s an accusation that might bring to mind alarmingly comparable lies that were spreading in the U.S. less than a year ago.\nThe film also shines through Naney’s aching performance, and she delivers a soul-shattering and scene-stealing monologue near the end about how a better life hasn’t found her despite all her hard work, belief and perseverance. Even in its shakiest moments, “Promised Sky” pledges to honor that grit and against-the-odds struggle with dignity and humanism.","extracted_keywords":["women","child","home","film","life","scene","drama","heart","feature","lives"]}

Chefs Thomas Keller, Jamie Oliver and Alice Waters were joined by David Gelb, the creator of “Chef’s Table” for an evening of clips, conversation and fine dining as part of the Reel Taste Film Awards, hosted by The Culinary Institute of America at Copia with the Napa Valley Film Festival.\nAll three chefs appear on the new season of “Chef’s Table: Legends,” now streaming on Netflix. Clips of the series were interspersed with a Q&A and the evening was topped off with a multi-course menu inspired by some of the chef’s most well-known dishes. At the end of the conversation, the chefs were jokingly asked if they ever have a craving for something as basic as a corndog. Waters, credited with beginning the farm-to-table movement, had to ask the other chefs for clarification on what a corndog is. After explaining it to her, the British Oliver admitted, “I didn’t know they existed until about five years ago. I’ll have to cook one up.” This prompted to Gelb joke, “I’m looking forward to the elevated corndog in the next season of ‘Chef’s Table.’”\nIn discussing the people and foods that inspired them, Oliver talked about growing up with parents who ran a pub and restaurant and appreciating food at an early age. He had a childhood friend who only ate jam sandwiches and at one point, Oliver offered him a taste of his salmon sandwich. Though the friend was suspicious, Oliver said, “He put it in his mouth and his face completely changed. He had this reaction to it being sour and soft and silky. So I knew at a very young age that food had this power – and once you had something good, it’s hard to go back.”\nKeller, whose restaurants include Napa Valley’s French Laundry, spoke on how it was a negative dining experience that actually helped form him. “The first time I walked into a fine-dining French restaurant, I was made to feel very uncomfortable,” he noted. “I thought, Why is that? The food is important, but it’s even more important to give people a sense of comfort. It’s very simple to make people happy, and that’s what we try to do.”\nEven before Waters spoke, the other guests frequently paid tribute to her influence, starting the farm-to-table movement and advocating for preparing food in season. Oliver revealed that as a teenager he came across a cookbook by “this foreigner from America” and spending hours with it. “I’m dyslexic so words have always been my enemy,” said Oliver before joking,” And Alice’s book didn’t have pictures.” But he made a point to really study it, and it changed his whole perspective. “I thought, how can people talk about food like this? There must be more than just craft and process.”\nWaters spoke about how her junior year of college, she took a year off to go to France. “It was an awakening to me,” she noted. “As an adult, I had never been a farmer’s market. I had never tasted things like this.” Instead of trying to create a flashy new dishes, Waters concentrated on finding the freshest produce from farmers she got to know personally.\nWaters went on to open her restaurant Chez Panisse, and recalled the time she served a skeptical José Andrés the simple dessert of two dates – only for him to declare it a revelation. Said Waters, “And that is what I was looking for.”\nCulinary Legends Thomas Keller, Jamie Oliver and Alice Walters Celebrate 10 Years of ‘Chef’s Table’ at Napa’s Reel Taste Film Awards\nMore from Variety\nLoading comments...","extracted_keywords":["table","waters","food","chefs","people","years","conversation","dishes","dining","season"]}
{"url":"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/catch-22-modern-marketing-campaigns-variety-entertainment-1236378913/","title":"The Catch-22 of Modern Marketing Campaigns","extracted_core_text":"For a sense of the challenge of today’s incomprehensibly diffuse media ecosystem, consider the scope of activity in digital advertising within the Magic Kingdom alone.\n“In any given week, there are 4 billion to 5 billion ad impressions running across Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN,” said Josh Mattison, executive VP of digital operations for Disney Advertising, during a session at Variety’s Entertainment Marketing Summit. “In any given month, we see 50,000 pieces of ad creative come in.”\nMattison shared those numbers during a conversation about using AI tools to assist with the staggering volume of advertising and marketing materials that flow through Disney’s digital pipes. Those stats underscore the issue that vibrated underneath just about every panel at the April 24 event: The methods for capturing audiences’ attention are proliferating at an exponential rate, while many consumers — especially Zoomers and millennials — have grown increasingly allergic to the perception that they’re being sold something.\nPopular on Variety\nTo reconcile these difficulties, executives from legacy studios to streamers, TikTok and Google to Sephora and NASCAR kept sounding one crucial theme: authenticity.\n“All of us need to move away from this myopic view of demographics and start thinking more about who these people really are and how to have an authentic connection with them,” said Darren Abbott, Hallmark’s chief brand officer, in the opening roundtable. “When you’re authentic to them, the consumers will come.”\nFor many, this means leveraging as much data as possible to target audiences in increasingly personal ways. On the content-side, Mattison noted that metadata tagging has grown so sophisticated that ads can be tailored to individual scenes within a show: If a scene is set in a kitchen, for example, the subsequent ad break might feature one of the appliances in the room. But much more common are campaigns that focus on specific details of how audiences have already connected to a brand.\nFor the year’s first blockbuster, Warner Bros.’ “A Minecraft Movie,” that meant bringing established Minecraft creators into the process from the start, including casting them in the film. “If you’ve been a movie theater lately, you probably heard ‘chicken jockey’ screamed as loud as possible from some of the auditoriums,” said Cameron Curtis, Warner Bros. global digital marketing chief. “That was all intentional, part of collaborating with creators from the get-go, not thinking about them after we had already made the film.”\nUnderscoring just how maddening marketing can be today, however, other panelists emphasized the dangers of getting too granularly focused on servicing specific fandoms.\n“We are targeting our way to oblivion,” Gayle Troberman, executive marketing adviser for iHeartMedia, said in a panel about how so many consumers feel underserved. “We need to talk to more people to sell more stuff, not just people who love Taylor Swift and this kind of shoe and have cats and are really into pop music. If Taylor Swift just targeted Swifties, the Eras Tour wouldn’t have done a billion dollars. She targeted everyone.”\nIt’s the riddle of modern entertainment marketing: how to be at once comprehensive and bespoke, balancing two seemingly irreconcilable impulses within the same campaign. A perfect case study of this catch-22 was the discussion of “Wicked.” In one panel, Universal Pictures domestic marketing chief Dwight Caines said that the Broadway musical’s “rabid fan base” wasn’t enough to justify the two-film franchise’s $300 million budget, let alone set up the upcoming “Wicked: For Good” for success. “We had to expand beyond that,” he said. “We needed to reach audiences who said, ‘You know what, I don’t go to musicals, but I see myself in that movie.’”\nBut earlier in the day, NBCUniversal franchise and brand strategy chief David O’Connor said that the marketing for “Wicked” in non-English speaking territories required a much more specialized approach. “We found ways to build a branded ecosystem in Japan that was very different than what we did domestically,” he said. “As much as we like to develop global strategies, you still have to think locally.”\nAt the same time, vexingly, thinking locally can have a global impact. In the final panel of the day, Netflix marketing VP Shelly Gillyard was asked how the streamer navigates its biggest worldwide campaigns. “We have the benefit of over 1.2 billion social followers, and they speak to us all of the time,” she said. “But we are finding, if something does not hit in Brazil, it does not go around the world.”\nSeated next to her, Sony Pictures global marketing chief Joe Whitmore — who will next release “Karate Kid: Legends” in late May — broke into a broad smile. “Well, luckily, ‘Karate Kid’ has a huge fandom in Brazil,” he said. “So I’m feeling very good!”\n(Pictured top: Cameron Curtis, Warner Bros.’ executive VP of global digital marketing, digital creator Leenda Dong and Brandon Lentino, Viral Nation’s VP of creative and experiential, at Variety Entertainment Marketing Summit presented by Deloitte)","extracted_keywords":["marketing","panel","audiences","chief","ad","consumers","people","brand","film","today"]}
{"url":"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/clown-in-a-cornfield-twist-1236361725/","title":"'Clown in a Cornfield' Has the Biggest Twist Since Cabin in the Woods","extracted_core_text":"The horror film “Clown in a Cornfield” has a title that certainly delivers on its promise to ticket buyers: Yes, there is scary clown action in a cornfield. But as fans of Adam Cesare‘s hit 2020 YA novel know, there’s plenty of twists below the surface we won’t spoil here — and many tell deeper truths about the heartland.\nThe initial plot concerns sullen teen Quinn (Katie Douglas) and her fraying bond with her depressed father (Aaron Abrams), who move to a sleepy Midwest town that is decaying after the local corn syrup factory shudders and is burned down. After falling in with a group of troublemaking teens, a clown that resembles Frendo, the factory’s mascot, begins terrorizing the town and targeting Quinn and her buddies. Yet near the midpoint of the movie, there’s a scene that plays against horror movie tropes so effectively that it acts as a reversal of everything the audience has seen so far.\n“From day one on the books I knew this was going to draw comparisons to clown horror,” Cesare says. “But this is a masked slasher story — it’s not Pennywise. It’s almost like the promise of a weird mash-up like ‘It’ meets ‘Children of the Corn’ on the cover, and then makes people say, ‘Ohh, that’s not what it is,’ but not in a bad way. It’s like you did a fun bait-and-switch once you realize what the conceit is. Then the goal with these stories is every 20 minutes, every 40 pages to switch it up.”\nPopular on Variety\n“It’s this physical, silly title, but ultimately it’s also about something really deep, which is classism in America,” director and co-screenwriter Eli Craig says. “This is a movie that has all these layers of depth to it as well. I think it surprises people because it’s about the decadence and the generational anger in America that is disintegrating our society right now.”\nWhile simple on the surface, Craig feels like the plot’s basic elements have deep ties to American history.\n“Corn is an American crop, and cornfields are iconically American, and so are clowns,” he says. “Clowns are embraced by Americana in the ’30s, and as we were developing the clown we were looking at pictures of Lon Chaney from the movie “A Thousand Faces,” of clowns in the little top hats they used to wear. There’s something so sad about those happy faces. The duality of a clown is like the duality of America: It’s hopeful, and yet it’s falling to pieces at the same time, and it’s angry. There’s so much anger hidden beneath this plasticky facade of happiness.”\nCraig seems like the perfect match for the material, given his history with horror satires that flip conventions on their head. His first feature was the cult hit “Tucker & Dale vs Evil,” which humanizes the backwoods hillbillies often mistaken for murderers in slashers, and “Little Evil,” a send-up of devilish kid films like “The Omen,” starring Adam Scott.\nCraig says the best way to combine satire, scares and humor into a digestible package is to focus on the key emotional relationships and branch out from there.\n“I love the backdrop of horror and suspense, and I love the world of horror cinematically,” he says. “It excites me as a filmmaker, but I do see the horror as more of a backdrop to tell stories about people, whether it’s comedy like ‘Tucker & Dale,’ which is ultimately about a guy overcoming his insecurities, or this movie, which is about a girl bonding with her father and overcoming some of her weaknesses to rise up and be a stronger person. I see the genre as a cool backdrop for the human story.”\nEarly audiences have reacted well to the genre blend of “Cornfield.” Although the film had its world premiere in March at South by Southwest, both Craig and Cesare were also present at the film’s April 5 debut at the Overlook Film Festival in New Orleans, a horror fan-focused event where the audience gave a unique jolt of energy to the screening.\n“The screening here was a blast,” Craig says. “It’s such a great crowd. It feels like the right town for it, and it feels like the anti-corporate film festival because it’s so small and such a fan-based community. So it’s really fun to watch with this crowd.”\nAnd of course, like any good slasher, fans already have sequels on the brain. Cesare is hard at work on the fourth book in the franchise, which means there are already two books written and ready to go should the duo, who became fast friends while first discussing the film, have the opportunity to further explore Quinn’s story.\n“Let’s pray that this becomes a hit movie,” Craig says. “It’d be a blast to have a chance to play with a clown like Frendo again.”\n“Clown in a Cornfield” will get a theatrical release via RLJE Films and Shudder on May 9.

Gets 'Superman' Copyright Lawsuit Dismissed","extracted_core_text":"A judge has thrown out a lawsuit challenging Warner Bros.‘ copyright to “Superman” in 10 countries, finding that the federal courts have no jurisdiction over the dispute.\nMark Peary, the nephew of late “Superman” co-creator Joe Shuster, sued the studio and its DC Comics subsidiary in January, arguing that Shuster’s estate had a right to cancel “Superman” copyrights in the United Kingdom, Canada, Ireland, and other territories.\nIn a ruling on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman held that the court has no authority to address the estate’s rights under foreign laws.\nPopular on Variety\n“The Court concludes that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over this case; the case therefore must be and is dismissed,” Furman wrote.\nUndeterred, Peary filed a nearly identical lawsuit on Friday morning in state court in New York. The state suit seeks an injunction that could, in theory, interfere with the July 11 release of “Superman,” the franchise reboot directed by James Gunn and starring David Corenswet.\nPeary’s lawyer, Marc Toberoff, previously sought a federal injunction that would block the film’s release in the U.K., Canada, Australia and Ireland unless the Shuster estate were compensated.\nIn throwing out the federal lawsuit, Furman also denied the injunction as moot.\nThe “Superman” copyright has been the subject of decades of litigation, ever since Shuster and Jerome Siegel created the character and sold it for $130 in 1938. In 2013, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeal rejected the Shuster estate’s claims, finding that Shuster’s sister had signed away all rights after Shuster’s death in 1992.\nToberoff argued that the 9th Circuit opinion settled the matter with regard to U.S. copyright law, but left the estate’s overseas interests unresolved. He argued that under British law, the estate had a right to terminate the copyright in 2017, 25 years after Shuster’s death.\nToberoff argued that U.S. courts have authority under the Berne Convention, the international copyright treaty, to enforce overseas copyrights. Warner Bros.’ attorneys countered that the Berne Convention is unenforceable in federal court.\nToberoff has not sought to bring copyright suits in the U.K. or the other territories, which would present various inconveniences.\nThe studio attorneys also argued that the “Superman” copyright issue has been exhaustively litigated and resolved.

Film Festival appears to be thriving. The fest, which runs April 24-29, received over a thousand submissions this year, a record for the festival. This year, the Central California Coast town will wel- come such luminaries as Jay Duplass, Daryl Hannah, Neil Young and Bob Mackie for special screenings and events.\nSkye McLennan, executive director of the festival and the SLO Film Center, joined the fest at a pivotal time for its 2020 iteration, which went online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But having spent years working on the festival circuit, she has her own theories as to what sets this one apart. “Location has a lot to do with it. It’s just such a beautiful, idyllic place. You’ve got the beach nearby, mountain hiking, all these things,” she notes. And it doesn’t hurt that events are mostly centrally located, with three downtown theaters and multiple restaurants to pop into. “The walkability of it is amazing. It’s a beautiful time of year to be out with the sun shining, seeing so many people walking around with the passes,” she adds.\nBut there’s also the people themselves — some three hours from Los Angeles, the town is filled with film fans, embracing the movies and their makers. “I think the peo- ple here are very down to earth and really open and curious,” McLennan says. “We have that kind of small-town charm, we’re all supportive of each other. I hear a lot of feedback from filmmakers that they really love our audiences and their questions and we’re so lucky to have that.” It helps that the small-town charm is complemented by some big perks, including day spas with natural hot springs and over 300 wineries nearby — the county is one of the top wine regions in the United States.\nAnd of course, there’s the movies. Over 100 films from more than 22 countries will be showcased by a wide range of filmmakers, from students to award winners. Asked if there’s a common thread of the type of films they’re looking for and McLennan says, “Definitely good movies.” She elaborates, “In programming we’ve made a big effort to have diversity behind the cam- era as well and we have a huge majority of women filmmakers we’re showcasing this year.

The biggest name in streaming kept things intimate, with a scant 500 or so people in attendance. Compared to Disney, which filled a convention hall at the Javits Center, and NBCUniversal, which took over Radio City Music Hall, Netflix’s presentation felt downright cozy.\nJude Law and Jason Bateman opened the show with some discussion of Netflix’s reach and programming before some playful banter and hyping up their new drama series “Black Rabbit.”\nPopular on Variety\nAmy Reinhard, Netflix’s president of advertising, took the stage next, telling advertisers in attendance that Netflix shows are not just put on in the background and ignored. “When you compare us to our competitors, attention starts higher and ends much higher,” Reinhard said. “And even more impressive, members pay as much attention to mid-roll ads as they do to the shows and movies themselves.”\nReinhard briefly yielded the stage to “Emily in Paris” star Lily Collins, who appeared via video to talk about the Netflix ad suite. Emily is a marketing executive, after all. This was followed by a clip from “Bridgerton” Season 4 and a tease of the final episodes of “Squid Game.”\nMarian Lee, Netflix’s chief marketing officer, took the stage next to highlight some of Netflix’s biggest campaigns like Domino’s teaming with “Squid Game,” or TurboTax teaming with WWE. “Together, we can bring stories to life in ways none of us can do on our own. That’s our idea of the perfect partnership,” Lee said.\nThose in attendance were treated to a new look at “Wednesday” Season 2 before “Strange Things” stars Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin, and Noah Schnapp came out promising an “epic” conclusion to the supernatural drama.\nThere was a very awkward transition between the “Stranger Things” footage to “Nobody Wants “This,” with Kristen Bell and Justine Lupe up next. They teased the second season of the hit comedy before Adam Brody popped up in the crowd to ask a question before joining Bell and Lupe onstage along with fellow cast members Timothy Simons and Jackie Tohn.\nBela Bajaria, Netflix’s chief content officer drew laughs from the crowd when she said one of the main reasons she was excited to work at Netflix was the fact that she would no longer have to fly to New York on Mother’s Day for the upfronts like she did in her broadcast days.\nBajaria, always one to break some news, made some big announcements on the TV side, including a two-season renewal for “Bridgerton,” an early Season 4 renewal for “The Diplomat,” quick Season 2 renewals for “The Four Seasons” and “Forever,”\nFilm was also part of the festivities (as it seems to be for every upfront presentation nowadays). Bajaria also announced the film “Here Comes the Flood” starring Denzel Washington and Daisy Edgar-Jones, as well as the Jamie Foxx-led “Fight for ’84.” More stars took the stage to promote their upcoming films, including Charlize Theron, Taraji P. Henson, Sherri Shepherd, and Teyana Taylor.\nBajaria also spoke glowingly about Netflix’s growing live events business, including WWE’s “Monday Night Raw,” NFL Christmas Day games (complete with an onstage appearances by Roger Goodell, Jerry Jones, and the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders), and the highly-anticipated boxing rematch between Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano.","extracted_keywords":["stage","things","attendance","season","upfronts","presentation","drama","shows","attention","members"]}

For the “Severance” director and executive producer, fan interactions are one of the positive things about being a public figure.\n“I find it, actually, really inspiring to be interacting with the audience because we never had that, my generation growing up,” Stiller told Variety at the “Severance” Season 2 FYC event on Saturday in Los Angeles. “When somebody doesn’t like something, I’ll [still] go back and forth with them sometimes and I find that fun, too, because usually once you start talking to somebody or interacting, something positive can come out of it. It’s also kind of fun. And at the end of the day, I don’t really take it that seriously.”\nStiller’s social media interactions have come at a time when “Severance” truly hit the zeitgeist with fan theories. For this season in particular, that included the meaning of the mysterious Cold Harbor file and the outies secretly hijacking their innie’s bodies at work.\nPopular on Variety\nTramell Tillman, a breakout star of the show for his performance as Mr. Milchick, found the work retreat episode, where Helly (Britt Lower) is exposed as Helena by Irving (John Turturro), the hardest to keep under wraps.\n“I could not wait for people to experience that because when I was at home and I read the script for the first time, I nearly tossed my laptop down,” Tillman said. “I felt betrayed. I felt lied to! I said, ‘The whole time?’ So it was really rewarding when that episode aired and I got to see the reactions of the viewers and how they responded to that reveal.”\nFollowing the season finale, many fans speculated whether the version of Helly who runs off with Mark (Adam Scott) in the hallway, leaving Gemma (Dichen Lachman) behind, is actually Helena. While Lower previously disproved that theory, show creator Dan Erickson sees those interpretations as an indicator of people’s genuine investment.\n“I think that people really do love Gemma and they love Mark and Gemma, and the idea of Mark and Helly sort of making this choice that is so heartbreaking, I think some people have trouble with that. And I understand it — they should,” Erickson said. “I don’t see it as a moment of somebody stealing somebody else’s lover. I see it as a moment of somebody claiming their own autonomy and the importance of their own existence.”\nEven when fans were able to catch onto twists, like the big Episode 4 reveal with Helena, Scott thinks people reading into it is ultimately for the better.\n“It didn’t matter whether people thought that was true, didn’t think it was true, was completely convinced of it or was maybe on the fence,” Scott said. “It’s actually fun to kind of have that idea rummaging through your head and not exactly knowing one way or the other. It was something we were worried about, like, ‘Are people going to be able to guess?’ But then once some people did, it actually enhanced the experience of the show.”","extracted_keywords":["people","time","media","fan","interactions","fun","season","work","episode","fans"]}

In the 1984 Olympics, the U.S. won nine gold medals in boxing, the most in Olympic history.

Though greatly outnumbered, her captors have overlooked her greatest weapon: 35 years of surgical experience, leading to what the synopsis describes as an “explosive and brutal confrontation” during which she outwits and cuts down her enemies “in a visual style that defies anything you have seen before.”\nPopular on Variety\n“I’m so excited to bring something brand new and innovative to the action genre based heavily on my medical background,” said writer/director Sethi. “I cannot think of a better partner than Michelle, the iconic queen of action who will be using her skills in a different and surprising way in this film, and the producing teams at Thunder Road, 193 and NeoText.”\nIwanyk and Erica Lee are producing “The Surgeon” for Thunder Road, alongside John Schoenfelder and Russell Ackerman for Neotext, Adam Kolbrenner for Lit Entertainment, and Steve Klinsky for Untravelled Worlds. Executive producing are Lit Entertainment’s Patrick White and Jay Schuminsky.\n“Roshin wrote an incredibly complex and compelling character that was able to excite one of the world’s great actresses in Michelle Yeoh,” said Iwanyk. “I can’t wait to see what that collaboration cooks up. And to work again with Patrick, who was so instrumental in getting the ‘John Wick’ and ‘Sicario’ franchises made, is a great thrill for Thunder Road.”\n“Michelle is a cinematic force and a perfect match for this role,” added Wachsberger. “She blends grace and power, bringing emotional depth to even the most physical sequences. With her leading the cast and Roshan drawing on his singular perspective to tell a story only he could, we have a captivating franchise coming to life, and we look forward to bringing it to audiences around the world.”\nSethi won a Film Independent Spirit Award in 2021 for his debut feature, “7 Days.” A radiation oncologist-turned-filmmaker, he first leveraged his medical experience on the CBS series “Code Black,” before co-creating “The Resident,” which ran for six seasons on Fox.\nIn addition to an Academy Award, Yeoh’s performance in “Everything Everywhere All At Once” earned her a Golden Globe, Film Independent Spirit Award, and Screen Actors Guild Award. She also starred in the massive hit “Wicked,” “A Haunting In Venice,” “Transformers: Rise Of The Beasts,” “Crazy Rich Asians,” and “Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2.” She has “Wicked: For Good” upcoming, as well as the fourth and fifth installments in the record-breaking “Avatar” franchise.","extracted_keywords":["action","film","franchise","feature","writer","director","surgeon","experience","world","oscar"]}

Discovery Offers Batman, 'Friends' as Figures for Ads","extracted_core_text":"Warner Bros. Discovery characters appear in movies, TV shows, comic books and videogames. Now the company wants to make a new effort to book them cameos in commercials.\nAs part of a new initiative known as “WBD Storyverse,” advertisers can gain access to use some of the company’s best-known characters, including those who appear in films and series such as “Elf,” “Harry Potter,” “The Big Bang Theory,” “The Matrix,” “Family Matters” and “Friends.”\n“Audiences have a deep connection to our stories, and we want to offer that connectivity in service to our partners,” says Sheereen Russell, executive vice president of client partnerships at Warner Bros. Discovery, in a statement. “By blending fresh ideas with the familiarity of our beloved worlds and characters, we empower marketers to spark cultural conversations and delight consumers with meaningful moments.”\nPopular on Variety\nTo be sure, advertisers have licensed popular characters and programming concepts for years. Warner’s DC Comics superheroes, for example, have regularly appeared in print ads for Hostess pastries and Snickers candy bars over the years. In more recent endeavors, Comcast was able to gain permission from director Steven Spielberg to use characters from his landmark 1982 film “E.T.” in a 2019 Thanksgiving Day ad for cable and broadband services (it helped that Universal Pictures, the distributor of the film, is a Comcast subsidiary). NBC lured new ad deals from Volkswagen and Allstate, among others, by allowing the use of characters from famous “Saturday Night Live” sketches in special commercials tied to the long-running program’s 50th anniversary.\nNow Warner seems to hope to reduce some of the barriers to entry. The company says it will consider granting permission for use of characters and talent tied to past projects for advertiser that wish to use them when investing ad dollars in its linear, digital and social channels. The properties aren’t to be rented out to the highest bidder; executives wil be seeking a strategic fit.\nThe company has signed off on similar projects in recent months. It allowed Batman to be used in a widespread State Farm campaign that put the popular superhero in an action sequence alongside actor Jason Bateman, and granted consumer-products giant Unilever the ability to use characters from the 1989 film “When Harry Met Sally” in a recent Super Bowl commercial that also tapped the stars of that movie, Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan.\nThese concepts can help the commercials stand apart from the rest of the pack, suggest executives who used the Warner properties. “By weaving the iconic State Farm brand assets and humor into the world of Gotham City, we created a campaign that broke through into pop culture in a massive way, delighting everyone from casual to the most die-hard of Batman fans,” says Alyson Griffin, head of marketing at State Farm, in a statement. Unilever’s Esi Eggleston Bracey, the company’s chief growth and marketing officer, says the use of Crystal and Ryan helped capture market share and create “genuine cultural impact.”\nWarner Bros. Discovery says it intends to offer consultative services from in-house strategists and creative experts as well as production resources, and distribution via WBD platforms and third-party licensing. .","extracted_keywords":["characters","company","commercials","film","ad","use","advertisers","statement","concepts","years"]}

The film, the fifth helmed by director-producer Ryan Coogler — and the fifth starring leading man Michael B. Jordan — is performing well at the box office, and the surrounding buzz and headlines don’t seem to be slowing.\nMuch is being written about the film, its themes and its significance. What some are missing, though, is how this film has broken new ground with how it was financed and perhaps sets a new precedent for how producers finance films in the future.\nCoogler’s pact with Warner Bros., the studio that developed and released the film, featured two important deal points that some quoted said threatened to end the studio system.\nFirst, there’s the matter of reversion rights after 25 years, which means ownership of the film (and presumably any spinoffs, sequels or series that arise from it) will all eventually be owned by Coogler.\nThis is atypical. In fact, Quentin Tarantino is among a handful of film producers who’ve ever received such terms; Richard Linklater, Mel Gibson and Peter Jackson are the others. And it’s unusual because studios generally want to retain all rights to a film for as long as possible, and the producer/directors are paid a fraction of what a franchise generates. In a deal like this, that will happen for 25 years, and then Coogler will get back the rights.\nIf “Sinners” does become a massive franchise with spinoffs, that means Coogler has 25 years to build up a universe of ideas and revenue streams that he’ll inherit from Warner in 2050. While it’s not clear if that’s what Coogler will do, the financial implications suggest it’s something people are probably telling him he should do.\nThe second deal point that has everyone in Hollywood buzzing is day-one gross revenue sharing. The exact terms aren’t public, but it’s been reported that Coogler started earning 5% of gross sales, day one, pari passu (side-by-side) with the studio.\nThis is also unprecedented. For 100 years, the business model of Hollywood was that studios needed to recoup all their costs for making the movie, marketing it and getting it into theatres and homes around the world before the producers, directors and actors ever made a cent. Coogler earning money from the gross revenue along with the studio on day one means he can count in real time how much he’s taking in.\nThe Rise of Non-Studio Financiers\nI’m of the belief that signings like this will become the new normal for studio-financed film and television productions, not just because of the negotiation skills of a bankable auteur like Coogler but because of the other player in this deal forcing Hollywood to change: independent financiers.\nIn the opening credits of “Sinners,” you’ll see a firm named Domain Entertainment. This is a division of Domain Capital, a private equity firm that is expanding its footprint in film and television, mostly through the acquisition of catalogs of existing intellectual property and libraries of content.\nDomain is not a studio; rather, it’s essentially an investment bank. So why would Warner Bros., a studio with all the money and connections in the world, rely on an outside investment bank to finance a movie?\nThe answer is risk. A studio that 100% finances a film makes 100% of the profits if it’s a huge hit, but it also takes 100% of the losses if it’s not. After decades of over-investing in big-budget projects that underperform, many studios have realized this model is no longer necessary.\nThis, too, is not exactly new. In 2018, Warners co-financed the movie “Joker” with an independent financier, and Skydance, founded in 2006 by Oracle heir David Ellison, has been co-financing film and television productions with studios including Paramount, Sony and Amazon for almost two decades.\nWhat is new is the rise of producers, directors and filmmakers who master the art of working with independent financiers to give themselves leverage when negotiating within the studio system.\nWhile entirely avoiding the studios and producing films independently has always been an option, working with studios brought the A-list talent, massive budgets and ease of having everything a producer would need (soundstages, backlots, global reach)\nThe rise of co-financiers is what’s putting pressure on Hollywood to change its business models in exchange for more capital and lower risk. Producers who put together their films along with independent financiers enter the room with an inherent advantage.\nA filmmaker who walks in asking for unprecedented deal terms holds a lot of cards if they come with a partner offering to pay for half the movie. If the studio wants to reduce its own costs and risk by working with co-financiers, it has to negotiate with the co-financier(s) anyway.\nBut filmmakers who come in aligned with independent financing now have something the studios want and can use that to get what they want.\nWhile I have no knowledge of the actual numbers here, this is likely what led to such unprecedented deal points for Coogler. He didn’t just show up with ideas and his track record of success (which are impressive enough) — he essentially brought the money with him and therefore had the ability to negotiate on his own terms.\nJon Gosier is the founder and CEO of FilmHedge, an independent financier of film and television productions, with loans up to $25 million per deal. FilmHedge helps investment banks, family offices, private equity and institutional financiers mitigate risk while lending money to producers.\nSEE ALSO: Why Too Many Scary Movies Set for 2025 Theatrical Release Means Horror Overkill","extracted_keywords":["film","studio","deal","studios","producers","financiers","years","terms","movie","money"]}

It was 1984 and Cruise had just shot Ridley Scott’s “Legend.” He was back in the States visiting his sister Cass, who spotted Hoffman from across the restaurant.\n“She goes, ‘There’s Dustin Hoffman.’ I looked up and there he was, in a hat — he was doing ‘Death of a Salesman’ — and he was ordering takeout,” Cruise said. “She goes, ‘You go over there and say hello to him.’ I was like, ‘I’m not going to say hello.’ She goes, ‘You know him, you know his movies.’ And she doesn’t do stuff like that.

Over Foreign Copyrights","extracted_core_text":"The estate of Superman co-creator Joe Shuster sued DC Comics and Warner Bros. on Friday, seeking to invalidate the companies’ copyrights in several foreign markets.\nThe suit revives a long-running dispute that was last addressed by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeal in 2013. The court rejected the Shuster estate’s attempt to cancel the Superman copyright, finding that Shuster’s sister had signed away his termination right after his death in 1992.\nIn the new case, the estate’s attorney, Marc Toberoff, asserts claims under copyright laws in the U.K., Canada, Ireland and Australia. The suit comes months before Warner Bros. Discovery will release “Superman” this summer, relaunching the valuable franchise and starting a planned cinematic universe of DC characters.\nPopular on Variety\nIn the suit, filed in the Southern District of New York, Toberoff argues that the copyright reverted to the Shuster estate in most of those countries in 2017, and in Canada in 2021.\n“Yet Defendants continue to exploit Superman across these jurisdictions without the Shuster Estate’s authorization — including in motion pictures, television series, and merchandise — in direct contravention of these countries’ copyright laws, which require the consent of all joint copyright owners to do so,” Toberoff wrote.\nThrough a spokesperson, Warner Bros., which owns DC, said it will fight in court.\n“We fundamentally disagree with the merits of the lawsuit, and will vigorously defend our rights,” the spokesperson said.\nShuster and Jerome Siegel created Superman and sold the rights for $130 in 1938. Siegel died in 1996; the heirs of both creators have sought to reclaim the rights since then.\nToberoff has been involved in those efforts since 2001. DC sued him in 2010, accusing him of seeking to enrich himself by wrongfully working with the creators’ estates to try to wrest control of Superman. The company ultimately prevailed in a 2-1 ruling at the 9th Circuit.\nToberoff argues in the complaint that the previous litigation was limited to termination rights under the U.S. Copyright Act, and does not affect the estate’s overseas copyrights.\nThe suit states that under the copyright laws in the U.K. and the other countries at issue, the rights to Superman automatically reverted to the estates 25 years after the creators’ deaths.\nToberoff argues that the U.S. District Court has jurisdiction over the dispute in part due to the Berne Convention, the international treaty which the U.S. joined in 1988.\nAmong other things, the suit seeks an order blocking Warner Bros. from distributing “Superman” in the U.K. and other disputed territories without first obtaining a license from the estate.\n“We live in a global economy; studios like DC Entertainment and Warner Bros. cannot expect foreign countries to respect and enforce U.S. copyright law amidst rampant piracy, if we don’t respect and enforce their copyright laws,” Toberoff said in a press release. “This suit is not intended to deprive fans of their next Superman, but rather seeks just compensation for Joe Shuster’s fundamental contributions as the co-creator of Superman. The ball’s in DC and Warner Bros.’ court to do the right thing.”","extracted_keywords":["copyright","estate","suit","rights","laws","countries","court","creators","co","creator"]}

It does make reference to a federal film subsidy — a politically complicated undertaking which does not yet appear to have bipartisan support — as a “longer-term initiative,” but does not elaborate on that topic.\nPopular on Variety\n“Currently, more than 80 countries offer production tax incentives and as a result, numerous productions that could have been shot in America have instead located elsewhere,” the letter states. “Returning more production to the United States will require a national approach and broad-based policy solutions, including those we propose below as well as longer term initiatives such as implementing a federal film and television tax incentive.”\nThe letter focuses on three relatively small-bore measures, and asks Trump to support including them in the budget reconciliation package currently working its way through Congress. Those measures include an extension of Section 181, which speeds up the deduction of up to $15 million in production expenses.\nThe unions want to double that cap to $30 million — or up to $40 million for production in low-income areas.\nThe letter also seeks support for another deduction, Section 199, that expired in 2017. The deduction reduced corporate tax rates for certain forms of domestic manufacturing, including filmmaking.\n“A domestic production incentive would make the U.S. market more competitive and able to retain and return high-paying jobs tied to film and television productions – and the use of this deduction has historically promoted significant economic and job growth,” the letter states.\nThe union letter also seeks reauthorization of Section 461, which allowed companies to carry back their net operating losses for up to five years, thus using those losses to lower prior year tax bills. That provision was included in the COVID relief package, but expired in 2022. The letter argues it particularly helps film companies, which have very uneven income patterns.\nThe letter was signed by the leaders of the Directors Guild of America, SAG-AFTRA, the Writers Guild of America, the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, the Teamsters, the Producers Guild of America, Producers United, the Motion Picture Association, the Independent Film and Television Alliance, and FilmUSA.\n“The DGA remains focused on increasing the number of jobs for our members and other industry workers by incentivizing domestic film and television production at the federal and state level,” said Russell Hollander, the national executive director of the DGA. “This proposal is an important step in that direction, as we continue to push for a comprehensive federal tax incentive and other measures to combat the current decline in film and television production at home.”\nMatthew Loeb, the international president of IATSE, argued three tax deductions measures will help bring jobs home.\n“American film and television workers have faced unprecedented job losses due to aggressive overseas incentives and economic uncertainty,” Loeb said. “The federal government must provide a balanced, comprehensive response to level the international playing field and support American jobs.”\nAfter Trump first broached the idea of a 100% tariff on foreign-made films on May 4, the White House quickly made clear that no final decisions had been made. Trump also said that he would meet with the industry on the issue.\n“I’m not looking to hurt the industry,” he said. “I want to help the industry.”\nThe leaders of the studios held a meeting Friday to discuss how to respond. The joint letter emphasizes one of the MPA’s key talking points over the last week, namely that the entertainment business is a leading export industry, with a $15.3 billion trade surplus with the rest of the world.","extracted_keywords":["letter","production","industry","tax","film","jobs","television","unions","measures","deduction"]}

To be honest with you, it didn’t feel like that big of a deal to me only because Kai had been so feminine for so long.”\nKai will join her dad and his wife Taylor at the Ali Forney Center’s A Place at the Table Gala on Friday night in New York City. The center, which provides housing and support for homeless LGBTQ youth, currently serves more than 2,200 young people through its 24/7 Drop-In Center and network of 13 emergency and transitional housing sites. [Editor’s note: Variety’s Marc Malkin is a co-chair of the gala.]\nWhile Kai, who made her modeling debut in March walking the runway for Valentino before starring in an ad campaign for the luxury fashion house, may not be facing the same hardships as those seeking help at the center, Schreiber explained their need to step up.\nPopular on Variety\n“This isn’t just about representing the trans community,” he said. “This is actually a community of people who don’t have great resources, who don’t have access to help, who aren’t being protected and looked after by their families. These are people who are being rejected. These are people who are experiencing the harshest version of humanity that we can offer, and some of them are not surviving it.\n“We got to bear that in mind when we go out there and glam ourselves up and get ready to be seen, you know?” Schreiber continued. “That what we’re doing is actually raising money for a community that desperately needs it.”\nKai is embracing her space in the trans community like never before, Schreiber says. “Kai is such a fighter,” he said. “It’s important that she goes, ‘Hey, I am trans,’ and, ‘Look at me.’”\nSchreiber chooses his words carefully when asked to offer advice to parents of children coming out as trans. “I don’t know the answer for your kid,” he said. “I don’t know what it’s like for you to be a trans dad. I don’t know how you were brought up. I don’t know what religion you encountered or what your spirituality is. And for me to tell you what I think about my kid feels like an overstep.”\nBut then he adds with a laugh, “I guess if I would say anything to someone who’s having trouble with their trans teen or their adolescent trans kid it’s ‘Teenagers are a headache. They’re hard.’ It doesn’t matter whether they’re trans or not because you’ll come out of this. But a trans teen is going to be a teen. They’re such a pain so much of the time, and Kai is as feisty and outspoken as they come.”\nSchreiber isn’t oblivious to the political attacks against the trans community. Most recently, the Supreme Court upheld President Trump’s ban on trans service members in the U.S. military as lower courts hear cases trying to overturn the president’s executive order.\nHowever, Schreiber explains he remains hopeful. “I don’t like to dwell on it too much,” he said. “To some degree, I feel like I don’t want to overcook that fear or that anxiety. There’s enough in the world to be anxious and afraid about.”\nFor more information about the Ali Forney Center and A Place at the Table Gala, go to aliforneycenter.org.","extracted_keywords":["community","people","kid","teen","dad","center","housing","year","daughter","mom"]}

The industry worked like that forever.”\nPopular on Variety\n“You come into your sexuality and your desirability as part of your growth, and it’s exciting to blossom into yourself,” she continued. “You’re wearing the clothes you want, you’re expressing yourself, then you suddenly turn around and you’re like, ‘Wait, I feel like I’m being’—I don’t want to say exploited because it’s such a severe word. That term is so heavy, but yeah, it was a kind of an exploitation.”\n“Lost in Translation” stars Murray as a fading movie star in Tokyo who befriends Johansson’s college graduate amid a midlife crisis. Johansson would not go into specifics but did say “Bill was in a hard place” during the film’s production, adding: “Everybody was on tenterhooks around him, including our director and the full crew, because he was dealing with his… stuff.”\nJohansson said she never had worked with an actor in Murray’s “headspace” before. The two performers ran into each other earlier this year behind the scenes of “SNL50,” where Murray was in a much more spirited mood.\n“He’s such a different person now. I think life has humbled him,” Johansson said, confirming she was partly referring to his behavior on the set of the 2022 movie “Being Mortal” that resulted in the project being shut down. Murray said earlier this year that he gave a woman on set a kiss through a mask, although he maintained he was just being silly.\n“Certainly, yes—that was really bad,” Johansson said. “But I also know COVID was a hard thing for him. Life—all these things have led up to him being held accountable for that kind of behavior. But you know what? How wonderful that people can change.”\nSpeaking of her experience on “Lost in Translation” at large, Johansson added: “I’m pretty proud of how I handled myself. I really just did the work, you know? It’s a good tactic for pushing through stuff. Eyes on the prize.”\nHead over to Vanity Fair’s website to read Johansson’s cover story in its entirety.","extracted_keywords":["translation","year","sex","object","roles","woman","actor","kind","movie","stuff"]}

{"url":"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/ryan-coogler-sinners-box-office-thank-you-letter-1236375238/","title":"Ryan Coogler Reacts to 'Sinners' Box Office Win in Thank You Letter","extracted_core_text":"“Sinners” director Ryan Coogler has penned an emotional open letter thanking fans for showing up in droves to see the film in theaters, writing that his heart is “bursting” with “eternal gratitude.”\nCoogler’s movie, starring Michael B. Jordan as the Smokestack twins, won the weekend, grossing $48 million domestically and $63 million globally.\nThe only way they got to that figure, the filmmaker writes, was thanks to the fans who bought a ticket: those “who decided to drive to see the film in different formats. Who bought popcorn and a drink, booked a sitter and carpooled, and stood in the lobby afterwards and talked and made a friend. Who changed their work schedules. Who saw the film in groups. … who watched more than once, who recommended the film to others, both in person and on social media or on your text message chains.”\nIn the typed letter, Coogler writes about what it meant to have “the gift of the opportunity of making a film inspired by my family and my ancestry,” but how he was equally driven by a desire to please theatergoers. “We always had our minds on you, the audience, and felt a deep responsibility to entertain you, and move you in the way only cinema can,” he writes. “I believe in cinema. I believe in the theatrical experience. I believe it is a necessary pillar of society. It’s why me and so many of my colleagues have dedicated our lives to the craft. We don’t get to do what we do if you don’t show up.”\nPopular on Variety\nHe continues: “The global theatrical audience has allowed me to dream, find a career, and build a more sustainable life for me and my family. And the only way that I know how to thank you for that, is by continuing to mine my personal human experience and my relationships for more stories to bring to you in cinematic language. To see your response to the film has re-invigorated me and many others who believe in this art form.”\nCoogler’s overarching sentiment was simple — audiences showing up to theaters the way they did for “Sinners” begets more opportunity for filmmakers to take big swings like it in the future. “Together maybe we can expand the definition of what a blockbuster is, what a horror movie is, and of what an Imax audience looks like,” he writes. “I’ll see you at the movies, popcorn bucket in hand!”\nIn addition to thanking the fans, Coogler also lists off a slew of his cinematic influences for the movie, which included but were not limited to: “Spike Lee, John Singleton, Ernie Barnes, Steve McQueen, Ava Duvernay, Euzhan Palcy, Eudora Welty, Oscar Micheaux, Robert Rodriguez, Barry Jenkins, Quentin Tarantino, Nicolas Roeg, Andrea Arnold, Jeremy Saulnier, Paul Thomas Anderson, Joel and Ethan Coen, Bill Gunn, Jordan Peele, John Carpenter, Boots Reilly, Shaka King, Nia Dacosta, Terence Nance, Rian Johnson, Bradford Young, David Cronenberg, David Lynch, Chris Nolan, Emma Thomas, Theodore Witcher, Francis Coppola, Julie Dash, Steven Spielberg, Kahlil Joseph, Mati Diop, Ben and Josh Safdie, Stephen King, Robert Palmer, Amiri Baraka, Martin Scorsese, Brian De Palma, George Lucas, Ta-Nehisi Coates, Walter Mosley, Stephen Graham Jones, Joel Crawford, Wes Craven, and many others.”\nAs much of the movie’s press revolved around Coogler’s lengthy partnerships with Jordan (five movies over 13 years); composer Ludwig Göransson (17 years) and his producing partner and wife Zinzi Coogler (a “near lifelong partnership,” he writes), the filmmaker also made a point to spotlight his longtime editor Michael Shawver, who he’s been working with for 15 years. “Michael did EXCEPTIONAL work on this film that isn’t being talked about enough, and he missed the press tour to spend time with his beautiful kid,” Coogler writes.\nThe letter (pictured above) was presented with a photograph of Coogler’s family, including his aunt Sammie, for whom a central character is named, and his late uncle James, whose love of the blues was a major inspiration for the film.\n“Blues music was like his life. He wasn’t a musician, but he was a listener, so that’s how I came to know the medium,” Coogler previously told Variety. “I would listen to it because I missed him; I’d listen to it to try to bring him back to life, so to speak.”\nOne song in particular — a track called “Wang Dang Doodle” — inspired the 1930s set movie.\n“The song is the story of a group of people in a small community throwing a party and they all have nicknames that imply that they’re gangsters,” Coogler explained, pointing out that some of his fondest memories were the parties his family would throw back in the Bay. “I was like, ‘Oh, wouldn’t it be cool if I made a one-day movie — which is more my favorite type of movie — where it’s this group of people, and everybody who they get together is dangerous, but they meet something that’s more dangerous than they could ever imagine.”\nThe story centers on twins Smoke and Stack (Jordan), who return to their hometown in the Mississippi Delta to open a juke joint. They enlist their young cousin Sammie (newcomer Miles Caton), a sharecropper and the son of a preacher who yearns to become a blues musician, for the evening’s entertainment. But his preternatural talent attracts more than local revelers; vampires descend on the party, culminating in a bloody fight for freedom.","extracted_keywords":["film","movie","way","family","letter","fans","audience","life","years","blues"]}

The Cannes premiere was a massive event, with a 40-piece orchestra welcoming guests into the theater with the franchise’s iconic theme before the screening.\nThe audience lapped up the film’s special effects but the long run-time left some theatergoers bleary-eyed and exhausted. In the final stretch of the film, featuring death-defying acrobatics from Cruise, a handful of attendees got up and fled the Palais.\nThough Cruise’s willingness to risk his life for “Mission: Impossible” has been covered relentlessly, what the Cannes audience did not expect was how much he was willing to bare all.\nPopular on Variety\nThe 62-year-old survived a three-minute knife fight sequence on a submarine wearing only skimpy boxer briefs. The same was true for part of the film’s mind-blowing underwater sequence. Honestly? The view wasn’t bad at all for a movie star in the fourth decade of his career.\nDuring the standing ovation, Cruise clutched his heart and nodded gratefully, with both he and director Christopher McQuarrie kissing and thanking guests Zoe Saldaña and Marco Perego-Saldaña. As the clapping continued, the camera panned to each member of the large cast, including Simon Pegg, Angela Bassett and Hayley Atwell.\n“This response is why we do it. You are why we do it. The big screen experience is why we do it,” McQuarrie then said in a speech, which ended up being longer than the ovation itself. “Thank you all for being here and for supporting us. I want to thank this extraordinary cast — when I tell you how extraordinary they are, it wasn’t just showing up to work every day. This film was made during a pandemic and two industry strikes. These two films were made over a period of seven years with a lot of uncertainty, a lot of gaps in between their faith and their hard work, their dedication, their unquestioning devotion to this. This film would not be possible without the hard work of each and every one of these people standing up here. It’s the most extraordinary cast in the world.”\nOf Cruise, the director continued: “As a kid, I didn’t fit in and a lot of my life was imaginative play. I got to grow up and have my very own action figure.”\nMcQuarrie then passed the mic to Cruise. “To be here in Cannes and have these moments — I mean as a kid when we were growing up, I really can’t even dream of something like this happening,” he said. “I think McQ said it all, I’m just very grateful for 30 years to be able to entertain you with this franchise.”\nAddressing McQuarrie, the movie star said, “Grateful to you, my friend. Every step of the way what you’ve done and how you’ve expanded it — it just went beyond our expectations. I look forward to making a bunch of other kind of movies with you, I can’t wait.”\nCruise and Paramount are surely hoping “The Final Reckoning” follows in the footsteps of “Top Gun: Maverick,” which dazzled Cannes in 2022 and earned a five-minute standing ovation on its way $1.46 billion at the worldwide box office that summer. The “Top Gun” sequel’s Cannes premiere was an extravaganza complete with eight fighter jets flying over the Palais as Cruise and the cast walked down the red carpet. Cruise was also awarded a surprise Honorary Palme d’Or before the screening.\nWhether or not “The Final Reckoning” can match the box office highs of “Top Gun: Maverick” remains to be seen. Cruise’s last “Mission: Impossible” outing, 2023’s “Dead Reckoning Part One,” ended its run with a disappointing $571 million worldwide, a sharp decline from the $791 million that 2018’s “Fallout” earned. But one can never doubt Cruise’s ability to deliver a blockbuster.\nIn addition to Cruise, “The Final Reckoning” brings back franchise stalwarts like Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames. The cast also includes Hayley Atwell, Vanessa Kirby, Pom Klementieff, Henry Czerny, Angela Bassett and Rolf Saxon, all of whom appeared in previous “Mission: Impossible” installments. Newcomers to the series include Janet McTeer, Hannah Waddingham,and Nick Offerman. The film is directed by Christopher McQuarrie, who helmed three previous “Mission: Impossible” movies.\n“Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning” opens in theaters May 23 from Paramount Pictures.","extracted_keywords":["film","reckoning","cast","franchise","ovation","minute","lot","death","screen","premiere"]}

(Phillipe turned 50 in September.)\n“It’s just so humbling. Even if you take care of yourself, which a lot of people in our industry do, right? You exercise and all of this, it’s still — you wake up with a soreness that’s just randomly materialized out of nowhere that you can’t trace back to anything you did,” he says, laughing. “It’s just there, and you got to deal with it. You know that the inevitable breakdown is something hard to reconcile, I think, for all of us.”\nHe says he’s still an “adrenaline junkie,” but a more cautious one these days. “The things I used to do back when I was shooting an action series, I would never allow them to double me. I would do all of my own stunts. I’d be involved in the choreography,” Phillippe says. “Then you get to an age where you’re like, ‘Ah, maybe the double should do this one.’ It’s like I don’t like getting to that place, but you have to be smart about taking care of yourself and the production.”\nPopular on Variety\nIn “Motorheads,” his new drama series premiering on Amazon Prime Video on May 20, Phillippe plays Logan, whose sister-in-law, niece, and nephew leave New York City to move in with him in a rust-belt town in Pennsylvania.\n“We’ve always said the comps are sort of like if you took ‘Fast & Furious,’ ‘Friday Night Lights’ and ‘Outer Banks’ and made a series,” Phillippe says.\nThe young cast, including Michael Cimino (“Love, Victor”) and Melissa Collazo (“One of Us is Lying”), turned to Phillippe for advice. “I felt like Yoda, they would all come to me with questions about what the old days were like,” Phillippe says, adding, “If they had questions about the industry or about upcoming decisions that they were making about project, I would be a sounding board. I have had a lot of experience. I’ve been through a lot of ups and downs professionally and that sort of thing, and I’m very open about sharing my experience. Why have experience if not to help guide others in some way?”\nPhillippe and Reese Witherspoon’s 21-year-old son Deacon plays Logan’s brother in flashbacks. “Our kids grew up on sets,” says Phillippe, who also shares a daughter, Ava, 25, with Witherspoon. “They grew up around the industry. But he’s a musician first and foremost. He’s at NYU at the music school, and I think he’s just one of those who’s taking the opportunities as they come. I don’t think he wants or needs to define himself just yet. He never came to me and said, ‘Dad, I want to be an actor.’ I think it’s something he’s still figuring out and exploring.”\nPhillipe was just a tad younger than Deacon when he landed his first major film role in Ridley Scott’s 1996 action adventure movie “White Squall” opposite Jeff Bridges. “I was 19. I came from a blue collar family who didn’t travel a whole lot,” Phillippe recalls. “That movie took us to eight different countries. We were in South Africa, we were all over the Caribbean, we were in Malta, we shot in the U.S., we were in London. It was such a big production that I was so wide-eyed, and it felt like the thing that I had always dreamt about. Just the size of that production and such a great group of young guys that all bonded, and we had Jeff Bridges to look up to as the master of the ship, the captain of the ship. I still flashback to that experience. It was so formative.”\nPhillippe was 29 when he came close to landing Anakin in the “Star Wars” franchise before being deemed too old to play opposite Natalie Portman, who’s seven years younger than him. “Being a kid born in the ’70s, I was like, ‘What a dream that would’ve been,’” he says. “But I think things happen for a reason and it’s easy to make peace with that. Part of what we have to develop as actors is that thick skin that comes along with rejection or maybe things not going the way you wanted in a particular project or potential job. So there’s an element of being able to let go and release and not spend too much time thinking about those things.”\nAs the July release of the “I Know What You Did Last Summer” sequel gets closer, Phillippe also reminisced about being killed off in the original 1997 movie. “I feel like I made the wrong move dying in all of these projects because then when they’re resurrected, I don’t get to be a part of them,” says Phillippe, whose characters also met tragic ends in “Cruel Intentions” and television’s “Big Sky.” “I used to think it was cool. I’m like, ‘If I could take a character to their last moment.’ Now, I’m like, ‘What are you thinking? No, you want to live in case there’s more movies to be made.’ But it’s cool to see that those films, those projects have endured — that had the impact culturally that they did — that they would want to revisit them. It definitely makes you feel like a dinosaur or aware of your age, but at the same time, it’s a compliment to something that you were a part of that succeeded.”\nOf course, Phillippe can still enjoy the enduring popularity of his naked butt scene in “Cruel Intentions.” “I’ve heard about that for so many years now,” he says. “It could be worse.”\nCLARIFICATION: Phillippe’s butt was seen in “Cruel Intentions,” not in “I Know What You Did Last Summer.”\nYou can listen to the full interview on “Just for Variety” above or wherever you download your favorite podcasts.","extracted_keywords":["lot","things","experience","year","industry","series","production","movie","sets","set"]}

It’s something that I had done to someone else before, and I thought it was funny, and every time it happened, it was funny. I was wearing a mask, and I gave her a kiss, and she was wearing a mask. It wasn’t like I touched her, but it was just, I gave her a kiss through a mask. And she wasn’t a stranger.”\nPopular on Variety\nMurray admitted the incident still bothers him since shortly after, “Being Mortal” was shut down by “human rights or ‘H & R’ of the Disney corporation,” which he described as “more strident than some other countries.”\n“It turned out there were pre-existing conditions and all this kind of stuff,” Murray added. “I’m like, what? How was anyone supposed to know anything like that? There was no conversation, there was nothing. There was no peacemaking, nothing. It went to this lunatic arbitration, which, if anyone ever suggests you go to arbitration: Don’t do it. Never ever do it. Because you think it’s justice, and it isn’t.”\nHe continued, “But it was a great disappointment, because I thought I knew someone, and I did not. I certainly thought it was light. I thought it was funny. To me, it’s still funny, the idea that you could give someone a kiss with a mask on. It’s still stupid. It’s all it was.”\n“The Friend,” directed by Scott McGehee and David Siegel, follows New York City writer Iris (Naomi Watts), whose life of quiet and solitude is upended by Apollo, a great dane inherited from her late mentor.\nBack in April of 2022, production on “Being Mortal” was indefinitely suspended after a complaint was issued about Murray’s on-set incident. Based on Atul Gawande’s 2014 book “Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End,” the film was to star Murray, Ansari and Seth Rogen. The movie was ultimately never finished.","extracted_keywords":["mask","incident","kiss","set","misconduct","movie","film","arbitration","debut","complaints"]}

{"url":"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/tom-cruise-mission-impossible-future-cannes-talk-1236397134/","title":"Tom Cruise Doubts Mission: Impossible Future During Cannes Talk","extracted_core_text":"In a wide-ranging masterclass at the Cannes Film Festival, Christopher McQuarrie delved into the evolution of the “competitive” film business and why his collaboration with Tom Cruise offers a blueprint for how to keep theatergoers heading to the cineplex.\nThe “Mission: Impossible — The Final Reckoning” writer-director-producer told French journalist Didier Allouch that the theatrical experience is under siege thanks to the rise of streaming.\nPopular on Variety\n“I’m not sitting here to advocate for [streaming] because I’m a diehard believer in the big-screen experience, and I believe that what makes film special is that however many hundreds of strangers have all come together to sit in a room and watch something together and experience something together,” he said. “Streaming is in danger of driving that into extinction.”\nAbout 20 minutes into the hourlong conversation, Cruise made a surprise appearance, just one day after the mega-movie star previewed some of the “never been done” stunts in the film as part of a TikTok creator workshop at the festival.\n“He doesn’t just write for me. He’s able to come in and write for the actor,” Crusie said of his frequent collaborator who he affectionately calls McQ.\nWhile many industry observers expect this film to be the final installment in the multi-billion dollar franchise, Cruise didn’t exactly rule out future chapters when asked about the “Mission” future.\n“I’d rather just people see it and enjoy and we’ve had an amazing time doing it and it’s been a lot of fun and I just want you all to enjoy it,” the actor said. “Enjoy this and know everything is the culmination has come to this moment right now.”\nCruise discussed how McQuarrie’s style offers a needed throwback to the Hollywood films of yesteryear, something he says is on display in the eighth installment of the franchise.\n“It goes back to silent movies,” Cruise said. “When you’re looking at this film, you’re going to feel how the close-ups are used with the characters.”\nMcQuarrie, who grew up watching movies from the ’70s and even much older classics, talked about how Cruise will not take “no” for an answer when it comes to the daredevil stunts that will be on display tonight in the film.\n“Tom said, ‘I want to be zero G in between the wings of the plane,'” McQuarrie said as Cruise laughed alongside. “And these people who do this for a living and are part of a decades-long tradition, said, ‘No, you’re not going to do that. And Tom said, ‘Thank you for your time.’ And we went on to some other people.”\nCruise also acknowledged that he is loath to recognize that word “no.”\n“Don’t ask permission to do it. Just do it. So, don’t wait till everything’s perfect because it’s never going to be perfect. Movies aren’t perfect. People aren’t. Life isn’t perfect,” Cruise said. “But you want to go at it, and it’s better to do it.”\nWhen it comes to performing the franchise’s famed stunts, Cruise says fear isn’t part of his psyche.\n“I’ve always felt, you know, I don’t mind kind of encountering the unknown, and I like the feeling. It’s just an emotion for me. It’s something that is not paralyzing. It doesn’t bother me,” he said. “I enjoy any endeavor in life. People can be afraid to do something, and I’m like, ‘OK, I want to.’ I don’t mind kind of confronting it and going in … People can be quite frightened about the unknown, and I never have been.”\nElsewhere in the talk, McQuarrie railed against the competitive nature of Hollywood and how it negatively pits films against films, studios against studios and actors against other actors.\n“One of the problems with contemporary cinema, particularly Hollywood, is over the course of my career, I’ve watched it develop into a competition. It has become about who crushes whom,” he said. “Tom Cruise is competing with no one but himself. He understands, and together we understand, that nobody wins unless everybody wins.”\n“The Final Reckoning” debuts out of competition tonight as one of the most anticipated films to hit Cannes this year. Paramount is releasing the event film worldwide on May 21.","extracted_keywords":["film","people","films","streaming","stunts","franchise","movies","reckoning","experience","actor"]}

{"url":"https://variety.com/2025/film/features/ryan-coogler-sinners-miles-caton-1236357916/","title":"How Ryan Coogler Discovered 'Sinners' Breakout Star Miles Caton","extracted_core_text":"When Ryan Coogler began developing his latest film “Sinners,” he knew one role would be particularly key: that of Sammie, the teenage cousin of Michael B. Jordan’s gangster twins Smoke and Stack.\nSammie is a young sharecropper and the son of a local preacher, but he dreams of becoming a blues musician, so the twins recruit him to perform at their new juke joint. There, his preternatural musical ability sets off a chain of supernatural events. It was a tricky part to cast, requiring a performer who could sing as powerfully as they deliver drama.\nCoogler and casting director Francine Maisler fielded audition tapes from all over the world — some from musicians who’d never acted before, others from actors who’d never played music and everything in between. But one teenager’s tape stood out.\nPopular on Variety\n“He was just in the dark — like he didn’t turn his lights on. Something about that was, like, so intriguing,” Coogler tells Variety. “This kid looked like he was in his basement, like in between homework assignments. But he had this voice — a once in a lifetime voice — and he also felt like the character.”\nThat kid was Miles Caton.\nAnd what Coogler didn’t know was that Caton is a child prodigy, the son of gospel singer Timiney Figueroa, and he’s been performing since he was a toddler. His powerhouse vocals have attracted the attention of gospel greats like Fred Hammond, Faith Evans, Erica Campbell and Bishop TD Jakes, as well as Oscar- and Grammy-winner H.E.R., who enlisted Caton to join her on tour all before he’d finished high school.\n“You could just tell the kid was special — like, as a person,” Coogler says about digging deeper into Caton’s background. “He was a good enough singer that he didn’t have to finish high school, but he did anyway. There was something to that. I was like, ‘Oh, man, we’ve gotta bring this kid in.’”\nEven though we’re meeting over Zoom, from the second Caton pops up on screen, it’s obvious what Coogler is talking about. The young star, who turned 20 just before the “Sinners” press tour kicked off, is dressed down in a black bomber jacket, rimless glasses and a Yankees ballcap. He’s youthful but has gravitas. He’s a seasoned performer, but he’s also humble about stepping into a new medium. (Caton acted in a school play and he’d shot a short film, but he’d never done anything quite like what “Sinners” required.) Above all, he’s really excited about starring in his first movie.\n“I’m overwhelmed. It’s still hard to process,” Caton says, grinning as he explains that he saw the finished film a few days prior. “It’s different filming than getting to see it on the actual screen. I was like, ‘Damn, that’s me!'”\nHere, Caton reflects on the whirlwind experience of making his big screen debut with “Sinners,” which hits theaters on April 18, and what he learned from entering Coogler and Jordan’s orbit.\nDid you dream of becoming an actor?\nI’ve always been like the family clown, always trying to make people laugh. So, I guess subconsciously, acting was something I always thought I would do. But I never imagined something like this would present itself at this time. So I’m just excited to be in this moment.\nHow did you get on their radar?\nI grew up singing, and I had the opportunity to go on tour and sing background for H.E.R. when I was 16 years old, and we traveled all around the world. We got close — she became like a big sister to me — and she called me one day after we got back from tour, and she was like, “Bro, somebody was in the crowd watching you, and they want you to audition for this role. I think you’ll be dope.” I was like, “OK,” not really knowing what to expect. I did the audition, got a call back, and then sent in a couple of videos of me playing. A couple weeks later, I got the call, and that was it.\nThis was a top-secret project. How much did they tell you about it?\nWhen I first got the script, it was like a tiny side [about] a kid playing the guitar and I read a couple of lines. I didn’t know everything I do now, but I was like, I’m just gonna try and see where it goes. Then actually getting the whole script was just like, wow!\nOnce I got the role, they sent everything over, and I was blown away.\nSo, you were just going on faith …\nWe were going on faith! Ryan is a guy I’ve looked up to; he doesn’t have a bad film, so I was like, I know I’m gonna be good.\nWhat did you admire about Ryan’s work?\nWhat he brings to film is always so interesting. He makes it his own; he finds a way to always bring the culture in and ties everything together. From “Black Panther” to “Creed” to “Fruitvale Station,” it’s always heartfelt. You can always feel the film.\nWhat did y’all talk about the first time you met?\nThe first time I spoke to him was on a Zoom call, and we just got to know each other. He told me he was from Oakland, and I told him I was from New York, and we just chopped it up about the role and the opportunity. It was dope.\nWere you nervous or excited?\nI was excited! I’m like, “Yo, this is Ryan Coogler!” Like, this is a dream come true. He told me about the role, and he said, “I think you’re the guy for it.”\nWhat was that like to hear? You’ve never acted, but he saw something in you.\nThat meant a lot. It was just surreal. But I feel like, when it’s your time, it’s your time. You’ve just gotta be ready, and you’ve gotta show up.\nHow did you prepare to play this role?\nWe started preparation two months before filming. I had to learn how to play blues guitar, so I worked for two months with Randy Bowland. He’s an incredible touring guitarist and taught me the fundamentals.\nThen, I worked with a dialect and acting coach, Beth McGuire (who also works with Jordan), to understand the Mississippi dialect and learn all the nuances of the sound.\nHow many hours did you work on that blues guitar?\nProbably, like five to six hours every day. I got calluses!\nWhat do you remember about your first day on set? Who was your scene with?\nDay one was crazy. Just getting used to all the moving parts was a lot, but I was like, “Yo, I’m really here.” I was a little nervous, but I spoke to Ryan about it, and he was like, “Bro, just be yourself. Do you and you’re going to be good.” And after that, we just got into [the scene] with Michael B. Jordan.\nWhat was it like to look over and realize you’re about to do a scene with Michael B. Jordan?\nThat was incredible. Mike is a great person, man. He’s always supported me and has just been a dope person throughout the whole process. He’s always willing to give me advice and help me with different acting techniques.\nBut filming that day was crazy. I was like, “I gotta bring my A-game. I gotta be on point.” So, I memorized all my lines. I practiced over and over. One thing that I learned was that you can’t be afraid to make mistakes. Mike taught me that it’s about being present and having a conversation within the scene.\nYou hadn’t acted before, but you have been singing since you were … how old?\nLike three years old. Ever since I can remember. The singing and musical aspects of the film were something that I already knew I had in my wheelhouse. I still prepared for that, but the focus was on the acting and making sure I was doing my best.\nYou’re not only featured singing as your character in the movie, but you also contributed an original track. What was it like writing music inspired by the film?\nMan, that was special. I didn’t expect that to happen, but it’s really a blessing. I got to work with the incredible composer Ludwig Göransson — he’s the G.O.A.T. — and Alice Smith — she’s an incredible artist. We wrote a song together, and I can’t wait for y’all to hear it.\nDid the lyrics or the music come first? What is your process?\nWith this project, the music came first, and then we based the lyrics off the whole vibe and the heartfelt subjects of the movie.\nIs it fair to say that you, like Sammie, are a preacher’s kid?\nI grew up in church. My grandfather’s a pastor, so that’s a big part of [who I am]. I relate to Sammie a lot. His upbringing and the whole religious aspect of growing, not just as a man, but also growing in your faith, how you view the world, and how you move in it.\n“Sinners,” like every movie Ryan Coogler makes, has so many layers to it thematically. But it’s still a vampire movie, so it’s action-packed, scary and intense. How was it getting into the darkness?\nI grew up watching a lot of scary movies — “Friday the 13th,” “A Nightmare on Elm Street” and “A Vampire in Brooklyn” with Eddie Murphy — so that stuff never really bothered me. Those were kinds of things that were in my head coming into this project.\nIt was incredible to get on set and see the whole scene — like, from reading the script and then seeing how everything works with all the props, it just makes it feel real. Getting to see the special effects was pretty cool.\nWhat does your family think about your acting debut? What is it like for them to see you live this dream?\nMy family has invested in and poured into me my whole life, so this is special for them to see me reach something like this. I’m extremely blessed to have them in my life.

So, I’m looking to get into some more acting roles.\nDo you have a type of movie you’d like to star in? You mentioned you were kind of the clown of the family, so, comedy?\nI love comedy. Action.

And to underscore the claim that the platform drives culture, it invited a bunch of personalities to this year’s YouTube Brandcast upfront presentation to wow the crowd — including Lady Gaga; MrBeast (aka Jimmy Donaldson), YouTube’s most-followed creator; Brittany Broski; Sean Evans, host of “Hot Ones”; and gaming streamer IShowSpeed. Also on hand: NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell to talk up the league’s deal for YouTube’s first free livestreamed NFL game next season.\nAs far as monetizing the zeitgeist, YouTube’s biggest news Wednesday was the introduction of a new sponsorship package for advertisers to buy against major cultural moments such as the Oscars, Emmys and other awards-season events, as well as Black Friday post-Thanksgiving shopping and the PGA Championship.\nPopular on Variety\n“Today, YouTube has become the epicenter of culture — culture with a capital ‘C,’” YouTube CEO Neal Mohan said in his introductory remarks at the upfront. In a nod to musical guest Lady Gaga, he said YouTube is the place to not only watch her “Abracadabra” video but also videos breaking down exactly how to do the dance.\nIt’s the fourth year running that YouTube’s Brandcast has crashed the TV upfronts, which it held again at Lincoln Center’s David Geffen Hall in New York City. The pitch-fest comes as YouTube has been celebrating its 20th birthday this year.\nIn other news, YouTube also showed off a new “immersive” masthead for connected TV ads, coming later in 2025, which will give brands a “cinematic” edge-to-edge canvas for ads, said Sean Downey, Google president of Americas and global partners. It also announced a new ad format built with its Gemini AI model to identify and match ads with contextually relevant “peak moments” in popular YouTube content when audiences are most likely to be engaged.\nSEE ALSO: YouTube Says It Now Hosts More Than 20 Billion Videos\nAnother new feature coming to YouTube is the ability to shop directly on connected TVs with an interactive product feed. Powered by the Google Merchant Center, the CTV shopping experience lets viewers discover and purchase directly from their living-room TV. That builds on YouTube’s current CTV ecommerce offering which includes QR codes and send-to-phone functionality.\nAs announced Tuesday, YouTube will exclusively stream the NFL’s first Friday game of the 2025-26 season, to be played in São Paolo, Brazil, for free worldwide (with the exception of Canada and a few other countries). It’s the first NFL game that will be livestreamed by YouTube, coming after the platform has been the U.S. home of the league’s Sunday Ticket out-of-home subscription package for the past two seasons.\nGoodell announced that the Sept. 5 free game on YouTube will feature the L.A. Chargers hosting the Kansas City Chiefs. Also appearing at YouTube Brandcast were former New England Patriots players Julian Edelman and Rob Gronkowski.\nBefore the Brandcast presentation, YouTube produced a red carpet preshow co-hosted by YouTube creators Haley Kalil and Julian Shapiro-Barnum of “Recess Therapy.” Additional creators and talent walking the carpet included Adam W, Casey Neistat, HopeScope and Jordan Howlett.\nAccording to Nielsen, YouTube has been No. 1 in streaming watch time in the U.S. on TV sets for more than two years running — ahead of Netflix, Disney Plus and Amazon’s Prime Video — as of March 2025. And in February and March, YouTube was the top media company based on watch time across broadcast, cable and streaming in the U.S. on televisions.

{"url":"https://variety.com/2025/music/news/the-weeknd-hurry-up-tomorrow-interview-ending-career-1236268897/","title":"The Weeknd Gives New Details on Hurry Up Tomorrow, Ending His Career","extracted_core_text":"The Weeknd on the ‘Breakdown’ That Inspired His ‘Hurry Up Tomorrow’ Album and Film, and Why He Might Retire the Weeknd: ‘It Never Ends Until You End It’\nOn Sept. 3, 2022, on what was intended to be the final date of his exhausting “After Hours Til Dawn” North American tour, the Weeknd confidently took the stage of SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, before 80,000 fans, friends, label executives, his management and a camera crew shooting a climactic scene for his HBO drama “The Idol.”\nAs the dramatic opening music of “Alone Again” thundered across the stadium, he rose slowly from beneath the stage on a hydraulic platform onto a set depicting a ruined, dystopian city. He began singing the song’s opening verses, as he had over the tour’s previous 17 concerts, while wraith-like dancers shrouded in red gowns stood at attention around him. But when, approximately 45 seconds after he appeared onstage, he shouted, “Hey, Los Angeles!” between verses, his voice cracked. He opened his mouth to sing the next line, and for one of the first times in his life, his source of power — his unmistakable, one-in-a-million voice — was gone.\n“My body, and specifically my voice, had never failed me before,” he says now. “I’d been onstage with a high fever, completely sick; I’d been onstage in the middle of a breakup or a death in the family; and I’d lost my voice during a performance. But I was always able to fight through it.”\nOn that night, he tried to fight — he was able to sing in a low range but couldn’t come near the celestial heights that his powerful voice ordinarily can scale with ease. “I was doing all these vocal exercises onstage, like ‘Brrrrrrrrrrr,’ trying to get it back,” he says. But after a few minutes, he realized it just wasn’t going to happen.\n“I was defeated on the world stage,” he says and sighs, “with everyone watching.”\nIn a halting voice, he explained the situation to the SoFi audience, apologized, offered refunds and promised a rescheduled date. “I had to go out there and face it,” he says now. “And also, so they could see ‘I can’t physically give you the show that you paid for.’ When I watched the video later, the reaction actually wasn’t that bad. But in my head, all I heard was booing and screaming and hate and anger,” he says. “That’s how defeated I felt.”\nThe Weeknd (real name: Abel Tesfaye) is one of the world’s biggest music stars, with 67 gold and platinum albums and singles, and he’s the first artist to have 25 songs with a billion streams on Spotify, including 2019’s “Blinding Lights,” the platform’s most streamed song of all time at 4.6 billion. He played for a whopping 105,000 people at a single concert in Brazil last fall and has collaborated with many top artists, including Ariana Grande, Kendrick Lamar, Daft Punk, Lana Del Rey, Travis Scott and Madonna. He headlined the Super Bowl halftime show in 2021, spending $7 million of his own money on an elaborate, COVID-protocol-certified stage and 115 dancers. So pressure is nothing new to him. And needless to say, he has resources. But this problem wasn’t something that money or even medicine could fix.\n“I saw my doctor the next day, and he said, ‘There’s nothing wrong with you — your [vocal cords] are inflamed, but nothing out of the ordinary,’” the Weeknd recalls. “And that’s when we came to the realization that it was all up here,” he says, pointing to his head.\nExhaustion and stress, he says, were factors. He’d been dealing with major challenges throughout the oft-delayed tour, which was originally scheduled for the summer of 2020 and postponed several times due to the pandemic. And there were complications, logistical and otherwise, with “The Idol,” which had scrapped millions of dollars’ worth of footage from the original director, Amy Seimetz, and was being reshot, largely at the Weeknd’s sprawling Bel-Air home, with “Euphoria” mastermind Sam Levinson — a scheduling overhaul that meant the star had to shoot while on tour.\n“I just think it was the last straw, man,” he says now. “There was a lot of self-imposed pressure: flying to L.A. between concerts, getting into character” — as Tedros, the sleazy, cult-leaderish would-be artist manager to pop star Jocelyn (Lily-Rose Depp) — “shooting and then flying back for the next show.\n“But what led up to it? Maybe it was that year, but maybe it was my whole life: survival, school, family, friendships, relationships, making it in the music industry. I’d always kind of suppressed it. You know, delusion helps!” he says with a laugh.\nSomething had to give.\n“My voice has always been my secret weapon,” he says, “my superpower, to get through whatever I need to get through. And in that moment, reality hit: Everything can change after this moment.”\nYet his singing voice returned within a few days, and he delivered on his promises: He played not one but two make-up shows at SoFi several weeks later, but not before hauling his enormous set all the way across the continent, at great expense, to perform two other make-up shows for what had been the tour’s intended opening date in his hometown of Toronto, which had been postponed minutes before doors opened due to a countrywide wireless outage. The make-up concerts were rapturously received, and the triumphant SoFi dates even became a concert film.\nThe Weeknd continued the tour across Europe in 2023 and Australia last fall, and will conclude it with another global trek later this year. But the impact of the moment hasn’t faded, and the ensuing self-analysis not only produced his next creative chapter — it may have led him to close the book on the Weeknd itself, the persona that’s made him a superstar.\n“I knew that I really needed to sit the fuck down and figure out my life,” he says. “To understand what happened, face it, learn something new and start again. I’d had a kind of a mental breakdown, which is pretty much what this new album’s about.”\n* * *\nIf there’s one character trait that everyone who knows the Weeknd can confirm, it’s that he doesn’t do anything by half. So it’s very on brand that he channeled the above experience and the ensuing self-analysis into not one, but two ambitious projects: the “Hurry Up Tomorrow” album and film.\nThe album, out Jan. 24, is the final installment in the trilogy the singer began with 2020’s blockbuster “After Hours” and continued with 2022’s lower-key “Dawn FM.” Together, the albums comprise a loose narrative involving a semi-autobiographical character experiencing a dark night of the soul, as the Weeknd puts it, “touching on a kind of purgatory and getting to the darkest part until you find the light at the end of the tunnel.” Despite the heavy themes, the albums have produced six of those record-breaking billion-plus-streaming songs on Spotify, including “Blinding Lights,” “Heartless” and the chart-topping duet with Grande, “Save Your Tears.”\nThe film, due May 16 via Lionsgate, is a suspense thriller co-written by and starring the Weeknd alongside Jenna Ortega (“Wednesday,” “Jane the Virgin”) and Barry Keoghan (“Saltburn,” “The Banshees of Inisherin”). Loosely connected to the album, the film was directed by Trey Edward Shults, known for the 2019 drama “Waves” and the 2017 horror film “It Comes at Night.” Shults wrote the film with the Weeknd and “Idol” co-writer Reza Fahim.\nWhile the Weeknd, who turns 35 in February, shies away from revealing details about the film, broadly speaking, it continues the “After Hours” theme of a character struggling with his sense of self and delves deeply into the psychology of fame. Both the film’s original script and the new album were overhauled to incorporate the aftereffects of the Weeknd’s experience at SoFi.\n“I had a good chunk of the album done, but then [SoFi] happened, and other things happened after, and you go right back to the drawing board,” the Weeknd says. “Because this was a really important, pinnacle moment in my life. How could it not be? And as an artist, you’re telling a story, so you get under the hood and try to figure out what’s going on. In the process, I got closer, and I became more grateful — I know it sounds cliché and soft or whatever, but it’s the truth. I’ve been working on myself to not push people away.”\nWas that a problem before?\n“Yeah,” he says.\nHow come?\n“I don’t know,” he replies.\nAs he worked on the projects, “getting hit with the moment of ‘This could be all gone,’ it’s almost like my whole life flashed before my eyes,” he recalls. “And then I started thinking about family — my mother, my father, the people in my life. It’s just really hard to — ” He stops short. “I didn’t think I’d get so deep into this! I don’t want to give away too much.”\n* * *\nBringing that vision into a cohesive album is challenge enough, but making it into a coherent film is no small endeavor. The Weekend and co-writer Fahim set their sights on Shults early, after being especially impressed with his work on “Waves.”\nThe Weeknd recalls, “I gave him [the script], and said, ‘I need you to see yourself in this film, that’s really the only way it’s gonna work.’ He did, and he brought in a whole new element that’s very personal to him as well.”\nShults tells Variety, “From our first meeting, that’s what emboldened me: He really wanted me to make this my film and bring myself to it. And I was blown away by how well he responds to direction as an actor: There would be days where I was ready to walk away from a scene, thinking we got it, and he would ask for another take and push the scene to a new level. I don’t think people realize yet what a good actor he is.”\nThe Weeknd gushes when talking about his co-stars, Ortega and Keoghan. “Jenna brought so much depth to the character,” he says. “There was a scene where Trey and I looked at each other like, ‘On paper, this is just ridiculous — how is it going to translate on screen?’ And she said, ‘I have an idea.’ She led that whole scene — none of it was rehearsed, and a lot of my reactions in it are not acting.”\nOrtega says, “Abel is such a sweetheart, and really looked out for everyone on our set. It was so great getting to know him and help bring his vision to life.”\nKeoghan “was a friend of mine prior to all this,” the Weeknd continues, “and he was always number one on my list for his role. What makes him different from Jenna is that his talent is so raw, it just comes so naturally to him.”\nKeoghan tells Variety, “It’s so nice to collaborate with such a close friend, but also an artist who has expressed so much of himself through one medium and is now channeling it through another.”\nMusically, the “Hurry Up Tomorrow” album includes plenty of the sleek, chrome-plated hooks that have characterized many of the Weeknd’s biggest hits. But to a degree he hasn’t really done before, it also includes explorations of other genres: classic R&B, straight pop, acoustic guitars, fast beats and an epic, sweeping song, probably the finale, that recalls Prince’s “Purple Rain.”\nIt also features several major special guests, most of whom the Weeknd declined to make public just yet. However, one is pioneering producer-composer Giorgio Moroder, who is best known for his work with Donna Summer on iconic disco-era hits like “I Feel Love” and “Love to Love You Baby,” but was actually more influential to the Weeknd for his film scores, particularly “Midnight Express” and “Scarface.”\n“Giorgio is a huge inspiration for this album,” the Weeknd says of Moroder, who contributed keyboards, arrangements and vocals to “Hurry Up Tomorrow.” “His DNA has always been in all of my music, but I’m really honing in on it here, especially the operatic synths in ‘Scarface.’ This album feels almost like an opera to me,” he concludes, “this gothic, operatic finale to the trilogy.”\nMoroder tells Variety, “I’m thrilled to continue bridging the gap with Abel between the past and the future, creating something timeless yet innovative.”\nWith such a dream team of collaborators on the album and film, “Sometimes I even felt like, ‘Why not just tell the same story but with a different actor?,’” the Weeknd muses, “because it’s all kind of meta. But to connect it with the album, I felt like it was the only way to close the chapter.”\n* * *\nThere’s no need to describe the Weeknd’s Los Angeles home because you can see it in great detail in “The Idol.” Yet as our car pulls past the security at the front gate and into the circular driveway on this mid-December evening, the strange sense of being at the location where Tedros, the singer’s loathsome character in the show, committed dark acts is made even more surreal by the fact that the house is completely tricked out with Christmas decorations: wreaths and reindeer and hundreds of lights outdoors and two large, fully decorated trees inside.\nThe Weeknd’s love for the holiday season is reflected in this issue’s cover shoot too. “There was an idea to make [a themed cover] that fit with the album and whatnot,” he says, now, relaxing on a couch before a fire in his cozy living room. “But then I was just like, ‘The album’s coming out in the winter, so let’s make people feel like we’re in the winter!’ I’m a snow child, right? It’s just a ‘Happy 2025!’”\nThe Weeknd’s friendly demeanor and his rather adorable love for the holidays (he has Renny Harlin’s 1996 Christmas-themed thriller “The Long Kiss Goodnight” cued up to watch after our interview) can be jarringly at odds with the Weeknd, the often-dark persona he’s embodied for more than a dozen years. That entity emerged in 2011 as a previously unknown, shadowy figure who didn’t even have a publicity photo, but had released a mixtape, “House of Balloons” — for free, on his website — that changed the sound of R&B and much of pop music.\nThe son of Ethiopian immigrants, he was raised in the Toronto suburb of Scarborough by his mother and grandmother. “It was tough growing up where I was from,” he said the first time Variety interviewed him back in 2020. “I got into a lot of trouble, got kicked out of school, moved to different schools and finally dropped out.”\nHe showed musical talent early but was more of a movie buff; he’d hoped to attend film school but ended up pursuing music because he “couldn’t really make a movie to feel better, you know?” he says. “Music was very direct therapy; it was immediate, and people liked it. It definitely saved my life.”\nA rebellious teen, the Weeknd left home and was unhoused for a time (a period depicted in his 2020 song “Snowchild”), but when success arrived, it came fast: “House of Balloons,” which he’d released at the age of 21, saw him arriving seemingly as a fully formed artist. It lit up the music world in 2011 with its dark and unusual take on R&B, imaginative samples and most of all, his crystalline, unmistakable voice. Two more mixtapes followed in rapid succession, and by the end of the year, he had signed a major deal with Republic Records, which remains his label.\nWhile his music and his profile were initially dark and a bit obscure — he didn’t even play his first concert until after “House of Balloons” was released — when he pivoted to pop, he went big. He shifted his voice into a Michael Jackson-esque range and collaborated with producer-songwriter Max Martin, the most successful hitmaker of the past 25 years, as well as Grande, Drake, Eminem and others. While that first mainstream pop album, “Kiss Land,” met with a mixed response, he doubled down with 2015’s “Beauty Behind the Madness,” which spawned two multiplatinum singles that topped the Billboard Hot 100, “Can’t Feel My Face” and “The Hills.” The follow-up, 2016’s “Starboy,” was even bigger, with collaborations with Daft Punk, Del Rey and Kendrick Lamar and three top 5 hits.\nYet it was all a prelude to “After Hours.” Advanced by “Blinding Lights,” the album was released at the beginning of the pandemic and provided a kind of salve for homebound fans; it spawned multiple hit singles and led directly to his invitation to headline the 2021 Super Bowl halftime show. The “After Hours Til Dawn” tour, originally scheduled to launch in June 2020, finally got underway 25 months later and despite the bumps detailed above, is one of the most successful of all time, grossing more than $350 million — a figure that will grow considerably after its final legs launch this year and, presumably, carry into 2026 and possibly beyond.\nApart from the occasional mixed response to an album or a single, the only major hiccup, at least critically, was “The Idol.” Preceded by breathless reports of production problems and lurid content, its graphic sex scenes (which were spectacularly unsexy by design) and the Weeknd’s abusive character garnered more than a few negative responses. It’s not something he’s eager to discuss, but after some initial resistance, he returns to it.\n“We had a great cast and great crew. I made some really great friends, and I love seeing everybody thriving,” he says, mentioning co-stars Depp, Rachel Sennott, Troye Sivan and Moses Sumney. “I’m really proud of it — we all are. It’s unfortunate that, you know, it wasn’t met with the warmest [response], but we knew what we were making — something provocative and dark. Maybe it could have been told in a different way, maybe not. It was bigger than I expected. Not everything you put out is going to connect, and that’s fine. If it doesn’t, then”— he shrugs — “it was a time.”\nHe continues, “Believe it or not, none of [the criticism] felt personal. Of course, it gets to you — I’m not saying I wasn’t affected by it; I’m saying I didn’t take it personally. Like, nobody’s out to get you, you know? I love reading criticism, even if some of it didn’t feel constructive. I’m not expecting everybody to love ‘Hurry Up Tomorrow’ either. Some people might hate it, but that’s not why I’m doing this. I’m doing it because I’m an artist; it’s how I feel, and this is what I want to say.”\n* * *\nIronically, “Hurry Up Tomorrow,” the “After Hours” album trilogy and “The Idol” all are based in something that Abel Tesfaye the person has worked hard to avoid for his entire career: the drama of fame. He doesn’t go out much, rarely gives interviews, has been with the same management team since 2011 and only plays the industry game to the extent that he has to. Yet the shadowy way in which he arrived with “House of Balloons” — and the fact that, initially, the attention was based entirely on his music — has enabled him to avoid many of those trappings.\n“People get consumed, especially now, by the concept of being famous,” he says. “And I’m not good at being famous — I never will be. I’ve always been reserved. I don’t like going out, and I never wanted to be the face of the music; I wanted to write for other musicians. I have no desire to be great at that part of it, and I don’t put myself out there as much as a lot of my peers — not to take away from them. I really do think it is a talent in its own right. But I’ve been lucky enough to not have to do that.”\nOne reason is that in many ways the Weeknd is a character for him to inhabit, a costume to put on when he goes onstage or picks up a mic. And like many such costumes, it’s one he may have outgrown. While discussing the new album during this interview, he reveals — slowly, maybe reluctantly, perhaps not completely intentionally — that he might be retiring the Weeknd.\nHe’s spoken broadly about it in the past, but the possibility was advanced by billboards that appeared in major cities at the end of December, a couple of weeks after this interview, presumably teasing tour dates, that appeared to say “The Weeknd Is Near” but with blank spaces in place of three letters, so they read “The End Is Near.” He seemed to move closer to confirming it a few days later, posting images from all of his albums with the caption “The Weeknd / The End Is Near / 8 beautiful chapters in this story.”\nDuring the interview, after a couple of references to “closing this chapter,” he’s asked which chapter, exactly, he is referring to — the “After Hours” trilogy or his existence as the Weeknd?\nAfter a 30-second pause, he says, “I would say my existence as the Weeknd.”\nHe continues, slowly, “It’s a headspace I’ve gotta get into that I just don’t have any more desire for. I feel like it comes with so much …” He trails off before continuing: “You have a persona, but then you have the competition of it all. It becomes this rat race: more accolades, more success, more shows, more albums, more awards and more No. 1s. It never ends until you end it.”\nNot surprisingly, the moment at SoFi played a role as well. “Part of me actually was thinking, ‘You lost your voice because it’s done; you said what you had to say. Don’t overstay at the party — you can end it now and live a happy life.’ You know? Put the bow on it: ‘Hurry Up Tomorrow’? Now we’re here. When is the right time to leave, if not at your peak? Once you understand who I am too much, then it’s time to pivot.”\nTo be clear, he’s not saying he’s quitting music: “I don’t think I can stop doing that,” he says emphatically. “But everything needs to feel like a challenge. And for me right now, the Weeknd, whatever that is, it’s been mastered. No one’s gonna do the Weeknd better than me, and I’m not gonna do it better than what it is right now. I think I’ve overcome every challenge as this persona, and that’s why I’m really excited about this film, because I love this challenge.\n“But I just want to know what comes after,” he concludes, looking into the fire. “I want to know what tomorrow looks like.”","extracted_keywords":["album","film","music","voice","life","tour","people","character","hours","time"]}

Feldman is premiering his first narrative short, “Wait, Your Car?,” at a special TikTok event during the fest and Cruise’s “The Final Reckoning” debuts out of competition on Wednesday. Cruise began the conversation by telling Feldman that he got into Cannes at 3:30 a.m. that morning after receiving the BFI Fellowship in London on Monday night, adding that the team had “just finished” “The Final Reckoning.”\nWhen Feldman asked Cruise about the death-defying aerial sequence in the film, Cruise said he applied his “decades of knowledge” flying planes.\nPopular on Variety\n“I’m an aerobatic pilot being able to fly these airplanes, so I now choose the airplane and present it — what colors should they be, what engineers do I have building this aircraft and working on the engines and how far can I push that aircraft?” he said. “Now I have to hire the crew; I audition the crew around me. And I’m learning how to wing walk, and this kind of wing-walking that we’re doing has never been done before because what I want to do is really, really extreme.”\nThe Oscar-nominated actor said he wanted to “go zero-G” when walking between the wings of the airplane, which presented some logistical challenges. “I’m going, how long can I hold the airplane in an inverted position? The engine stops after a few seconds because it’s not a fuel injection, so I know the engine’s going to stop,” he said. “So what we have to do is just take our time, and I’m just approaching it step by step.”\nCruise went on to say that he hired “incredible” pilots for the sequence, but he also “had to train them how to fly the airplane with me on the wing.”\n“I’m a human being on that airplane — it was violent. It was so violent on that airplane,” he continued. “The amount of air force that’s coming over that wing…”\nAfter the 20-minute talk with Feldman, Cruise held a meet-and-greet with the TikTok creators, speaking with them one-on-one and taking photos.\nCruise has been making the press rounds lately ahead of “The Final Reckoning” premiere, giving a talk at the British Film Institute in London on Sunday (and also showing off his stuntman skills by appearing on the roof of the BFI Imax cinema). During his BFI conversation, Cruise reflected on the roles that made him a movie star, including the best picture-winning 1988 road comedy “Rain Man” alongside Dustin Hoffman. Cruise said that he landed that role after his little sister forced him to go up to Hoffman at a New York City restaurant in 1984.\n“I said, ‘Excuse me, Mr. Hoffman, I’m sorry… And he went, ‘Cruise!’” he recalled. Hoffman ended up offering Cruise and his sister tickets to “Death of a Salesman,” which he was starring in on Broadway at the time, and invited them backstage after the show. “As I was leaving he said, ‘I want to make a movie with you.’ And I said, ‘That would be nice, sir,’” Cruise said, laughing at the memory. “And that’s what happened, and basically a year later he sent ‘Rain Man.’”\nAfter premiering at Cannes on Wednesday, “Mission: Impossible — The Final Reckoning” debuts in theaters on May 23 via Paramount Pictures.","extracted_keywords":["airplane","reckoning","wing","creator","creators","debuts","conversation","death","sequence","aircraft"]}

Discovery thinks HBO has some pretty good brand equity, after all. This summer, streamer Max will bend the knee and rebrand back to its original name, HBO Max.\nThe change comes just over two years after Warner Bros. Discovery decided to drop HBO from the streamer’s name to become just Max. Note that while HBO and Max have carried separate commercial branding during that time, they’ve competed under one “HBO/Max” label for industry awards.\nThe surprise announcement, made less than two months after Max tweaked its logo to look more like the classic black-and-white HBO color scheme, was revealed at Warner Bros. Discovery’s upfront presentation to ad execs in New York on Wednesday.\nPopular on Variety\nIn a press release, WBD said “returning the HBO brand into HBO Max will further drive the service forward and amplify the uniqueness that subscribers can expect from the offering. It is also a testament to WBD’s willingness to keep boldly iterating its strategy and approach — leaning heavily on consumer data and insights — to best position itself for success.”\nWBD touted its streaming business growth, noting the division has improved its profitability by almost $3 billion in two years, and added 22 million subscribers over the past year. The company says the streamer is on track to reach more than 150 million subscribers by the end of 2026.\n“The powerful growth we have seen in our global streaming service is built around the quality of our programming,” Warner Bros. Discovery president and CEO David Zaslav told the audience in the Theater at Madison Square Garden. “Today, we are bringing back HBO, the brand that represents the highest quality in media, to further accelerate that growth in the years ahead.”\nWBD’s naming flip-flopping for its flagship streaming service — which has caused more than a little confusion among consumers — amounts to an admission by the company it can’t be as broad as the industry leader, Netflix. The original justification for dropping HBO from HBO Max was to signal a something-for-everyone content cornucopia.\nWarner Bros. Discovery president and CEO of streaming JB Perrette added: “We will continue to focus on what makes us unique — not everything for everyone in a household, but something distinct and great for adults and families. It’s really not subjective, not even controversial — our programming just hits different.”\n“With the course we are on and strong momentum we are enjoying, we believe HBO Max far better represents our current consumer proposition,” Casey Bloys, chairman and CEO of HBO and Max content, said. “And it clearly states our implicit promise to deliver content that is recognized as unique and, to steal a line we always said at HBO, worth paying for.”\nVIP+ Analysis: Why 2024’s Top Streaming Series Foretell a Radical Strategic Shift for Originals\nThe social media team at Warner Bros.

In his annual letter to the YouTube community, he asserted that creators are “becoming the startups of Hollywood” as they increasingly establish professional-grade media operations that are a far cry from the platform’s early DIY days.\nAnd in the U.S., the TV is now the No. 1 device for YouTube viewing — topping desktop and mobile — underscoring the platform’s growing presence in entertainment, according to Mohan.\nPopular on Variety\n“Today’s creators have moved from filming grainy videos of themselves on desktop computers to building studios and producing popular talk shows and feature-length films,” Mohan wrote.\nThe CEO cited sports creators and trick-shot specialists Dude Perfect, who recently opened a new $5 million headquarters in Texas; buffalo-wing-challenge talk show “Hot Ones”; and Inoxtag, a French influencer who produced a 2.5-hour documentary about his preparation to climb Mount Everest.\nVIP+ Analysis: How YouTube’s ‘Lite’ Subscription Offering Fuels Its Netflix Rivalry\nAmong other YouTubers he called out: Alan Chikin Chow, creator of “Alan’s World” and one of the top producers of YouTube Shorts videos, who opened a 10,000-square-foot studio in Burbank, Calif. (a “bold, fun and colorful space filled with cutting edge equipment that produces incredible entertainment watched by millions around the world,” wrote Mohan); Kinigra Deon, who is building a studio in Birmingham, Ala.; and the creators behind YouTube channels Mia Plays and Kouman, who opened their studio in North Vancouver last fall.\nIn 2024, more than 50% of channels earning at least $10,000 on YouTube generated revenue from sources other than ads and YouTube Premium, according to Mohan. Those include shopping recommendations and channel memberships. YouTube recently opened Communities, an enhanced fan-engagement hub that replaces comments, to “thousands more creators and we’ll continue expanding access this year.” The platform plans to launch Hype, a new feature that helps fans rally around up-and-coming creators, to more markets in 2025.\n“It’s still the very early stages of what creator-led startups will achieve, and we’ll be there to support them at every step of the journey,” Mohan wrote.\nTV recently surpassed mobile and desktop computers as the primary device for YouTube viewing in the U.S. by watch time, according to Mohan. According to Nielsen measurements, YouTube has been No. 1 service in time spent viewing in the U.S. on TVs for the past two years.\nIn December 2024, YouTube viewing on connected TVs in the U.S. increased to capture a record 11.1% share of TV usage among streaming platforms ahead of Netflix (8.5%), Prime Video (4.0%), Hulu (2.5%) and Disney+ (2.1%), according to Nielsen.\nYouTube’s growth on connected TVs is also attracting new advertisers, Mohan said. The platform continues to introduce “formats that work particularly well on the big screen, like QR codes and pause ads,” he wrote.\nVIP+ Analysis: YouTube’s ‘New TV’ Rationale: Distance From Its ‘Adpocalypse’ Past\nAs more creators produce content for TV screens, the CEO said, “we’re bringing the best of YouTube to TVs, including a second-screen experience that lets you use your phone to interact with the video you’re watching on TV — for example, to leave a comment or make a purchase.”\nYouTube also is testing a new feature called Watch With, which lets creators provide live commentary and real-time reactions to games and events. It first ran trials of the feature last year with the NFL and YouTube “will experiment with other sports and types of content this year,” Mohan said.\nIn his letter, Mohan also maintained that “YouTube will remain the epicenter of culture.” He cited YouTube estimates that on Election Day in the U.S. last November, more than 45 million viewers across the U.S. watched content related to the election on YouTube.\nHe also referenced Joe Rogan’s pre-election interview with President Trump, which racked up more than 55 million views on YouTube alone, and political comedy sketches on NBC’s “Saturday Night Live.”\n“From elections to the Olympics to Coachella to the Super Bowl and the Cricket World Cup, the world’s biggest moments play out on YouTube,” he said.\nMeanwhile, Mohan said YouTube is now the most-used service for listening to podcasts in the U.S., over Spotify and Apple Podcasts, citing research from Edison Podcast Metrics released in October. “We’ve long invested in the podcast experience and creators have found that video makes this format even more compelling,” he wrote. “This year we’ll roll out more tools to support podcasters, improve monetization for creators, and make it even easier to discover podcasts.”\nMohan closed the letter by discussing AI, saying that advances in artificial intelligence will make it easier “to create and enhance the YouTube experience.”\n“AI has long been a part of our journey, from powering recommendations to producing captions to helping us identify and remove harmful content,” he wrote.\nLast year, YouTube launched an AI-powered auto dubbing feature to help creators translate their videos into multiple languages. Later this month, Mohan said, YouTube will make auto dubbing available for all creators in the YouTube Partner Program. For videos with dubbed audio, more than 40% of the total watch time comes from viewers choosing to listen in a dubbed language, according to YouTube.\nVIP+ Analysis: Why YouTube Spending Signals a Changing Content Market\nAnother AI initiative Mohan cited was YouTube’s partnership with CAA to let talent identify and take down AI-generated fakes of themselves that have been uploaded to the video platform. “We’ll continue to responsibly harness the power of AI to enhance the YouTube experience for everyone,” Mohan wrote.","extracted_keywords":["creators","year","platform","tv","feature","video","videos","time","tvs","content"]}

This is clearly seen in the last decade of TIFF’s People’s Choice Award, whose winners and two runners-up have scored a remarkable 20 best picture Academy Award nominations.\nIn 2024, the People’s Choice Award was won by Mike Flanagan’s “The Life of Chuck,” which unusually didn’t score an Academy Award. First runner-up, however, was “Emilia Pérez,” and second “Anora,” adding new awards season momentum first sparked at Cannes.\nPopular on Variety\n“The People’s Choice Award has become a bellwether for how films perform in the awards season. Also, for the industry, it allows audience reaction to be gauged, which is crucial when sales agencies are trying to sell a film,” Anita Lee, TIFF’s chief programming officer told Variety at Cannes.\nNow, the new award may well anticipate voting for the international feature film category. There’s already a strong correlation between international films that were previous PCA winners at Toronto and Academy Awards’ international film nominations and winners, Lee noted. “We want to create greater opportunities for international films by establishing a dedicated award,” she said.\nPresented by Rogers, the new international award’s launch comes as Toronto audiences, especially globally networked younger spectators, show an ever larger interest in international films, Lee observed.\nIt’s also kicking into gear one year before Toronto launches an official market. “We want to lend greater support to international films moving forward, for the festival to further amplify as a critical international hub for festival selection as well as industry activity,” Lee said.\nTIFF added a People’s Choice Documentary Award and People’s Choice Midnight Madness Award in 2009.\nParts of the Toronto Festival selection of movies has also become more international.

{"url":"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/warner-bros-discovery-cable-networks-strategy-channing-dungey-1236396998/","title":"Warner Bros. Discovery: Cable Networks Strategy Under Channing Dungey","extracted_core_text":"Channing Dungey is five months into her new dual job as chairman and CEO of both the Warner Bros, TV Group and US Networks, having taken over most of the company’s basic cable portfolio in January. Now, prior to WBD’s upfront presentation on Wednesday, Dungey spoke to Variety about strategy for the networks and her first round of announcements — including two that harken back to her days as ABC’s entertainment prexy.\nAmong the programs revealed by Dungey at the Madison Square Garden event: Discovery’s “Dancing With Sharks” (working title) — yep, a cheeky play on the Alphabet net’s “Dancing With the Stars” and even hosted by that competition series’ former emcee, Tom Bergeron. The special, which will naturally run during Shark Week, is described as an “unprecedented underwater dance competition between expert divers and their shark partners.”\nAlso in the works: HGTV’s “Renovating the Bachelor Mansion” (working title), in which former “Bachelor” and “Bachelorette” contestants compete in design challenges to win a cash prize and help the “Bachelor” estate the facelift it needs after more than 40 seasons. (As an ABC exec, Dungey programmed “The Bachelor,” and now as studio chief, she oversees the Warner Bros. franchise.)\nPopular on Variety\nOther series Dungey was set to announce at the WBD upfront included two new entries for Food Network: “Family Recipe Showdown,” produced and hosted by Oscar winner Octavia Spencer, and “Guy’s Flavortown Games,” a new competition show hosted by Guy Fieri, in which he builds a real “Flavortown.”\nOver at Investigation Discovery, Dick Wolf’s Wolf Entertainment is partnering with Vanity Fair for an untitled anthology series looking at high-profile true crime cases; plus, Jennifer Love Hewitt will narrate and exec produce “They Know What They Did,” looking at how a murder impacted a variety of interconnected people. Dungey also announced a new OWN series, “Heart & Hustle: Houston.”\nBeyond those new series, Dungey confirmed that Max hit “The Pitt” will get a linear run on TNT this fall, before the Season 2 return of the show on the streamer.\n“I have a couple of goals more broadly in terms of what we’re trying to do here at the U.S. networks,” Dungey, whose remit now includes Discovery, Food Network, HGTV, Investigation Discovery, TBS, TNT, TLC, Adult Swim and OWN, told Variety. “The first is to create the next generation of culture-shaping programming within these brands, and tapping into what we do best, which is making shows that people love to talk about, and creating stars — whether they be on Food or HGTV or TLC — that audiences love to connect with. The second one is leaning into our ‘One WBD’ philosophy, which for me, means deepening our relationships with Max and also hopefully leveraging my position as head of Warner Bros. Television Group to do more WBTV programming on the U.S. nets. And then third, looking for ways to enhance and extend the power of our brands.”\n“Renovating the Bachelor Mansion” is an example of that kind of cross-pollination: “that is a nice collaboration between the US networks and Warner Bros. Television Group, because it’s our unscripted studio that will be producing that show,” she said, noting that they previously did that with Food Network’s “Harry Potter: Wizards of Baking,” which will be coming back for another season.\nIn expanding franchises, besides the expansion of the Fieriverse with “Guy’s Flavortown Games,” Dungey also pointed to the new TLC entry “90 Day: Hunt for Love,” the latest in a string of “90 Day Fiancé” shows.\nDungey’s early focus appears to be more on the lifestyle channels that continue to make waves with original fare, like HGTV, Food, ID and TLC. “Some of those brands, like HGTV and Food, they’re bigger than television,” she said. “I would go as far to say that they’re like a cornerstone of culture. A lot of our U.S. networks are a part of audiences’ daily lives in so many ways, even with all of the noise about the decline of linear. Obviously that’s true. Facts speak for themselves. But I do believe that our brands are going to continue to command attention and be influential, and that is part of what makes me so excited about being in this role.”\nScripted, on the other hand, is still a work in progress. And that means Dungey didn’t have much to report yet on TNT and TBS, other than sharing an update on the upcoming TNT scripted limited series now titled “High Value Target,” about the interrogation of Saddam Hussein in 2003. That project, previously called “Debriefing the President” (and based on the book of that name by former CIA officer John Nixon), marked TNT’s first scripted series pickup in several years.\n“Right now, we’re just evaluating what the right balance of scripted and unscripted fare will be on the T-nets,” Dungey said, adding that she’s asked Warner Bros. TV creative affairs president Clancy Collins White to see if there are opportunities to do the kind of shows the studio used to do for The CW (back when Warner Bros. was a co-owner), but for TNT and TBS instead.\n“I think that’s something that we would be very excited to figure out,” Dungey said. “Part of the CW strategy involved very successful output deal that we had going with Netflix. Are there ways for us to do that with Max, so that Warner Bros. could produce something that would go on the T-nets and then live on Max? It’s about figuring out what the type of programming is and what the budget around that programming is.”\nDungey noted that Warner Bros. Discovery research showed that audiences still identify TNT with the “We Know Drama” tagline, and TBS with “Very Funny” — even though neither has used those slogans in several years. That could also come into play as Dungey and her team ponder more comedies on TBS and another tentpole drama for TNT.\nIn the meantime, TNT is looking to turn its run of Max (soon to once again be “HBO Max”) hits like “The Pitt” into primetime events. The cabler previously aired HBO’s “True Detective: Night Country,” and will run the first season of “Peacemaker” ahead of the Season 2 launch. “Doing things like that, it’s great for us, and it also is helping Max as well,” Dungey said. “If it drives viewers to Max for the new season, that’s a win/win. As we look at developing programming, we’re always thinking about what would resonate, both for the linear networks and also for Max. The more we learn about the types of programming that we do that perform well on Max, that’s a real score.”\nAmong other networks in her portfolio, Dungey also points to the importance of Cartoon Network and Adult Swim in the mix. “We’re going to continue to develop new programming there as well,” she said. “’Rick and Morty’ is doing great. That’s our No. 1 series. And then we just renewed ‘My Adventures with Superman.’ Going back to that ’One WBD’ philosophy, the opportunity for us to be doing DC programming in that space is great.”\nDungey said she also is looking to continue to lean into events like Puppy Bowl and Shark Week, and that doing more live events is under consideration.\nOne thing she can’t discuss is recent reports that WBD might consider spinning off its cable networks in the same way that Comcast is moving many of its linear properties to Versant.\n“What I’ve got to do is keep my eye on the prize,” Dungey said. “I stepped into this role, not really knowing what to expect. And what I have discovered, besides the fact that we have some of the most passionate and engaged people working at the U.S. nets, is we have incredible brands. And the reach of the programming, still, even in this environment, is very large. I look at sort of the power of these brands, the quality of the content, the strength of the team. And I still feel really bullish. I have a lot of faith in our future.”\nHere are the new shows Dungey announced on Wednesday:\nFood Network\n“Guy’s Flavortown Games”: “In the new competition series ‘Guy’s Flavortown Games’ (wt), slated to premiere in early 2026 on Food Network and Max, two fearless chefs accept Guy’s invitation to the epic restaurant row at the heart of Flavortown Square. Their goal: to prove they have the cooking cred to prepare a winning dish in any type of kitchen imaginable.”\n“Family Recipe Showdown”: “Octavia Spencer hosts a multi-generational home cooking competition that celebrates secret family recipes and traditions—where pride is on the line and the stakes are deeply personal as duos compete for a $10,000 prize. Set against the backdrop of New Orleans, Southern cooking royalty and expert judge Edgar “Dook” Chase is joined by guest judges and Octavia’s celebrity friends, including Reese Witherspoon, Jessica Chastain, Danielle Brooks, Eric Stonestreet, Tina Knowles, Kandi Burrus, Tim Gunn, and Al Roker with his daughter Leila. Family Recipe Showdown will debut in late 2025 on Food Network and Max.”\nOWN\n“Heart & Hustle: Houston” (wt): “Produced by Jesse Collins Entertainment, the show follows a dynamic sisterhood of successful Black women in the vibrant heart of Houston. These women are redefining what it means to be a boss, a wife and a mother, while navigating a labyrinth of unique daily challenges. The series will premiere in Summer 2025 on OWN.”\nDiscovery\n“Dancing With Sharks” (wt): “Hosted by Tom Bergeron, ‘Dancing With Shark’s (wt) is a new Shark Week 2025 special that features an unprecedented underwater dance competition between expert divers and their shark partners. Blending skill, grace and the daring pursuit of the ultimate underwater thrill, five divers—all trained by a world-class underwater choreographer—will compete to show off their skills during epic underwater dances.”\nInvestigation Discovery\n“They Know What They Did”: “Narrated and executive produced by Jennifer Love Hewitt, each episode charts the journey to confront what really happened, revealing secrets and uncovering the truth. The stories unfold through first-person accounts of friends, family, locals, journalists and law enforcement. The series will premiere in Summer 2025 on ID and Max.”\nVanity Fair/Dick Wolf Series: “Vanity Fair, Dick Wolf and Wolf Entertainment are joining forces to present some of the most impactful stories with unparalleled access and exceptional reporting. Coming to ID and Max in 2026.”\nHGTV\n“Renovating the Bachelor Mansion” (wt): “In the new competition twist premiering in 2026 on HGTV and Max, former ‘Bachelor’ and ‘Bachelorette’ contestants who possess expert reno skills return to the house to duke it out in various design challenges with the hope of winning a cash prize.”","extracted_keywords":["series","programming","networks","competition","brands","prize","nets","divers","challenges","studio"]}

It’s produced by Tshepiso Chikapa-Phiri and Joel Chikapa Phiri for Known Associates Entertainment and Ariye Mahdeb for A-Game.

Discovery thinks HBO has some pretty good brand equity, after all. This summer, streamer Max will bend the knee and rebrand back to its original name, HBO Max.\nThe change comes just over two years after Warner Bros. Discovery decided to drop HBO from the streamer’s name to become just Max. Note that while HBO and Max have carried separate commercial branding during that time, they’ve competed under one “HBO/Max” label for industry awards.\nThe surprise announcement, made less than two months after Max tweaked its logo to look more like the classic black-and-white HBO color scheme, was revealed at Warner Bros. Discovery’s upfront presentation to ad execs in New York on Wednesday.\nPopular on Variety\nIn a press release, WBD said “returning the HBO brand into HBO Max will further drive the service forward and amplify the uniqueness that subscribers can expect from the offering. It is also a testament to WBD’s willingness to keep boldly iterating its strategy and approach — leaning heavily on consumer data and insights — to best position itself for success.”\nWBD touted its streaming business growth, noting the division has improved its profitability by almost $3 billion in two years, and added 22 million subscribers over the past year. The company says the streamer is on track to reach more than 150 million subscribers by the end of 2026.\n“The powerful growth we have seen in our global streaming service is built around the quality of our programming,” Warner Bros. Discovery president and CEO David Zaslav told the audience in the Theater at Madison Square Garden. “Today, we are bringing back HBO, the brand that represents the highest quality in media, to further accelerate that growth in the years ahead.”\nWBD’s naming flip-flopping for its flagship streaming service — which has caused more than a little confusion among consumers — amounts to an admission by the company it can’t be as broad as the industry leader, Netflix. The original justification for dropping HBO from HBO Max was to signal a something-for-everyone content cornucopia.\nWarner Bros. Discovery president and CEO of streaming JB Perrette added: “We will continue to focus on what makes us unique — not everything for everyone in a household, but something distinct and great for adults and families. It’s really not subjective, not even controversial — our programming just hits different.”\n“With the course we are on and strong momentum we are enjoying, we believe HBO Max far better represents our current consumer proposition,” Casey Bloys, chairman and CEO of HBO and Max content, said. “And it clearly states our implicit promise to deliver content that is recognized as unique and, to steal a line we always said at HBO, worth paying for.”\nVIP+ Analysis: Why 2024’s Top Streaming Series Foretell a Radical Strategic Shift for Originals\nThe social media team at Warner Bros. Discovery clearly knew the internet would have field day with the news of the reversion of the streamer’s name to HBO Max — and tried to get in front of memes about the switcheroo. “These rebrands are trying to murder me,” the (soon-to-be-defunct) Stream on Max account said in its updated bio on X Wednesday.\nAfter the coming change back to HBO Max was announced at the upfront, WBD relaunched its dormant HBO Max accounts on social media.\n“What is dead may never die,” the newly resurrected HBO Max on X account posted, featuring a clip from “Game of Thrones” Season 6 of Jon Snow coming back to life. “HBO Max coming this summer.

In addition, YouTube has developed synthetic-singing identification technology within Content ID that will let partners automatically detect and manage AI-generated content on YouTube that simulates singing voices. On Monday, YouTube announced that it will roll out an update to let creators and rights holders choose to allow third-party companies to use their content to train AI models.\n“At YouTube, we believe that a responsible approach to AI starts with strong partnerships. We’re excited to collaborate with CAA, an organization that shares our commitment to empowering artists and creators,” Mohan commented. “In the days ahead, we’ll work with CAA to ensure artists and creators experience the incredible potential of AI while also maintaining creative control over their likeness. This partnership marks a significant step toward building that future.”\nLast year, CAA launched theCAAvault, which scans, captures and securely stores clients’ digital likenesses (face, body and voice).

Netflix blockbuster “Stranger Things,” for instance, topped Nielsen’s list in 2022 with a mere 34 episodes.\nEven the most popular originals were no match in 2024, however, as top finisher “Bridgerton” trailed the no. 10 overall series (“SpongeBob SquarePants”) by a significant margin. Meanwhile, other marquee titles, including “Fallout” and “Fool Me Once,” ended up behind even dusty library shows such as “Little House on the Prairie,” which somehow racked up 13.3 billion minutes streamed on Peacock last year, according to Nielsen.\n(As an aside, it should also be noted that Nielsen made a key change to its streaming ratings methodology last year, which resulted in certain previously excluded linear shows — think “Family Guy” — being added to its streaming viewership tallies.)\nTempting as it may be, though, the success of broadcast titles on streaming should not be dismissed because of their inflated episode counts. It’s clear by now that reruns (if they can still be called that) of popular shows are just as valuable for SVODs as they once were for cable networks, helping to fuel sustained engagement on a platform — now by far the most important metric in the streaming game.\nAfter all, regardless of whether the time is spent with an original series or “Law & Order,” time spent is still time spent, and the fact that long-running shows can generate such enormous tallies of viewing time marks them as valuable properties for SVODs (particularly as ad revenues become more important to streamers’ bottom lines).\nThere’s another significant implication to this as well: With these consumption patterns in mind, it can only be a matter of time before streamers start attempting to replicate the sensibilities — and episode tallies — of network TV. Indeed, they already are.\nMax’s medical drama “The Pitt,” created by “ER” and “NCIS: Los Angeles” veteran R. Scott Gemmill, premiered on the SVOD this month with a weekly rollout of what will ultimately tally 15 episodes — at a time when most marquee streaming originals are shrinking their season orders to around half that. (To name just a few, “Bridgerton,” “The Boys,” “Fallout” and “The Rings of Power” all released only eight episodes last year.)\nAnd “The Pitt” has become, by Max standards, an enormous success, ranking among the top 20 most streamed SVOD originals as measured by Luminate each week since its debut.\nFor context, the show’s fellow Max original “The Sex Lives of College Girls” failed to chart at all in that time, despite rolling out the final episodes of its season. Furthermore, “The Pitt” accounts for more than a quarter of all viewing time for Max originals so far in 2025, with more than 578 million minutes streamed in total, according to Luminate’s SVM database.\nIn short, SVOD’s latest attempt to emulate a network TV approach is paying off, and more are likely to follow; Netflix’s own medical procedural, “Pulse,” is on track for a 2025 debut. And not for nothing, the second most streamed original of 2024 was “Love Is Blind,” an unscripted dating show whose premise would not be out of place opposite ABC’s “The Bachelor.”\nThe implications of this are potentially far-reaching for the content business. As post-peak TV programming strategies continue to take shape, streamers are likely going to be drawn to projects that can be produced on a lower budget while yielding more episodes to keep viewers engaged on their platforms.\nIn other words, like it or not, streaming platforms may start to look a lot more like network TV in the years ahead.","extracted_keywords":["time","originals","shows","series","episodes","year","network","tv","streaming","years"]}
{"url":"https://variety.com/vip/youtube-spending-content-market-shifts-1236197945/?cx_navsource=vip-insertion-text","title":"Why YouTube Content Spending Signals Changing Market","extracted_core_text":"In this article\nAs if dominating the Hollywood studios in the battle for viewers wasn’t enough, YouTube is now poised to outdo them on another front.\nNew research from Ampere Analysis found that what the research firm described as “the top six global content providers” will account for just over 50% of global content spending for full-year 2024.\nMaking up the top six are Disney, Comcast, Warner Bros. Discovery, Netflix, Paramount Global and, most notably, Google, whose “contribution to the content market comes via YouTube,” as Ampere explained, “and investment in programming through its revenue-sharing arrangements with content creators.”\nAs that statement suggests, comparing YouTube’s content spending to those of Disney, Netflix and the like is not a straightforward endeavor.\nUnlike the studios, which often take on substantial risks in producing and distributing multimillion-dollar creative gambles, the video giant’s exposure on content is extremely limited. The vast majority of material on YouTube is entirely user-generated and self-funded by its creators — or, if not technically self-funded, still not paid for by YouTube.\nThe payouts to creators, then, are only made after their content is not just completed but has attained a certain level of success. Per YouTube’s monetization policies, channels are not even eligible for payouts until they have attained 1,000 subscribers with 4,000 “valid public watch hours” within 12 months.\nThis is not to say the platform should not be taken seriously as a streaming competitor; indeed, YouTube’s business practices, and the benefits they have reaped, have profound and troubling implications for Hollywood.\nMost obviously, of course, YouTube’s user-generated content has proven highly successful at drawing consumers away from the traditional production pipelines of the film and TV industry. One need only look at Nielsen’s The Gauge report in any given month for evidence of YouTube’s dominance over U.S. viewers’ streaming time.\nBut perhaps more troubling is the fact that less than $18 billion paid out to myriad independent creators — less than $16 billion, in fact, given that Ampere’s figure includes the reported $2 billion YouTube now pays annually for NFL Sunday Ticket rights — is enough to make Google the third biggest spender in the global content market.\nIn 2020, per Ampere data, the tech giant’s programming outlays lagged far behind those of traditional Hollywood and Netflix, at less than $11 billion; just four years later, YouTube is paying more for content than any other company save Disney and Comcast — which are, not for nothing, the biggest spenders on pricey sports rights. (Disney’s figure also includes the $9 billion it paid to Comcast for Hulu in its fiscal first quarter, which, when excluded, brings the Mouse House’s total down to around $27 billion.)\nPlaced next to YouTube, the relative austerity of the legacy studios’ spending in the post-streaming recession, post-strikes, post-peak TV environment becomes all the more striking. At one time, the studios’ massive investments in top-of-the-line film and TV content simply couldn’t lure younger consumers away from YouTube; now their spending can’t even match Google’s payments to YouTube creators.\nIt’s a notable tilt in the content market — in other words, one that speaks to Hollywood’s shrinking economics in light of the competition from social video and the shift to streaming. Amid perhaps the greatest existential crisis in the industry’s history, a profound realignment of spending priorities may be needed to revitalize the studios’ fortunes.","extracted_keywords":["content","studios","creators","spending","market","streaming","tv","viewers","research","video"]}

It stars Ishaan Khatter (“The Perfect Couple”), Janhvi Kapoor (“Devara Part 1”) and Vishal Jethwa (“Tiger 3”).\nIn the film, two childhood friends from a small North Indian village chase a police job that promises them the dignity they’ve long been denied. But as they inch closer to their dream, mounting desperation threatens the bond that holds them together.\nPopular on Variety\n“Homebound” is co-produced by Mélita Toscan du Plantier, who also produced Ghaywan’s “Masaan,” which debuted at Cannes in 2015 and won the Avenir and Fipresci prizes in the Un Certain regard strand.\n“I have seen Neeraj’s first film ‘Masaan’ in 2015 and I loved it, so when Mélita Toscan du Plantier sent me the project of his second film, I was curious. I loved the story, the culture and was willing to help. Neeraj has made a beautifully crafted film that’s a significant contribution to Indian cinema. I am glad the movie is an official selection at Un Certain Regard in Cannes this year,” Scorsese said in a statement shared by Johar on his Instagram stories.\n“‘Homebound’ is an extraordinary confluence of talent, vision, and storytelling at its finest. Having @martinscorsese_ , a true legend of cinema, lend his wisdom and support to Neeraj’s remarkable vision elevates our film to a rare artistic height,” Johar posted on Instagram. “With an incredibly gifted cast and the prestigious stage of Cannes, we eagerly look forward to sharing ‘Homebound’s powerful story with audiences around the world.”\nScorsese is no stranger to Indian cinema with The Film Foundation’s World Cinema Project founded by him restoring Indian classics – most recently 1977’s “Ghatashraddha,” which bowed at Venice Classics last year.\n“I am still in disbelief! To have an icon like Martin Scorsese lend his name to our film, #Homebound, is an honour beyond words. I’m deeply grateful to our co-producer Mélita Toscan, who introduced us to him,” Ghaywan posted on X.\n“Mr. Scorsese mentored us through the screenplay and multiple rounds of editing. He listened with care, understood the cultural context, and offered thoughtful, incisive notes each time. His kindness and commitment are extraordinary, and to have him nurture our film has been both a rare privilege and a profoundly humbling experience,” Ghaywan added.","extracted_keywords":["film","cinema","selection","producer","story","year","homebound","vision","filmmaker","title"]}

Black Friday will really become a sports event that’s on Amazon all throughout the day.”\nPopular on Variety\nThe one-two punch of featuring two different major-league sports on the day after Thanksgiving sets Amazon up to be a bigger player in the fourth quarter of the year, a stretch of calendar that can bring in a significant chunk of ad dollars for most major media outlets. Amazon will work to connect its Black Friday sports coverage with a Christmas Night NFL game it gets as part of its “Thursday Night Football” package.\nAmazon, which will present its next programming lineup at a showcase Monday night, is just one of several media conglomerates hoping to use sports to win more ad dollars at a tricky time for Madison Avenue. Advertisers still covet large audiences that watch particular shows all at once, rather than beaming ads in piecemeal fashion to individuals who choose to stream their favorite programs at moments of their own choosing. And yet, the latter dynamic is becoming more prevalent, forcing media companies to dig deeper into sports and live spectacles such as award shows.\n“Sports is really the last thing left that can deliver a large-scale audience all at once, whjich is incredibly valuable,’ says Marine.\nAmazon hopes a widening sports portfolio will make it more relevant to advertisers throughout the year. Amazon’s NBA rights kick in later this year, part of a new 11-year deal the basketball league struck that will split its games into three different packages spread across Amazon’s Prime Video, NBCUniversal’s NBC and Peacock and Disney’s ABC and ESPN.\n“I would say that ‘Thursday Night Football’ helped establish us” with advertisers, says Marine of Amazon’s NFL package, which it won sole control over in 2022. “One thing they wanted is more.” In addition to the new NBA package, Amazon also holds rights to some NASCAR races, some WNBA games and some NWSL matches.\nThe broader portfolio gives advertisers a way to stick with Prime Video “12 months a year.”\nHe suggests Amazon will use many of the concepts that bolstered “Thursday Night Football” with the NBA. Viewers will be able to choose to see different on-screen graphics packages that pair statistics with game movement. The company is still considering whether to present so-called “alterna-casts” with NBA games, Marine says. Its “Thursday Night Football” has been paired with simultaneous broadcasts of the game with the improv group Dude Perfect or the team of Hannah Storm and Andrea Kremer, the first all-female broadcasting team tied to the NFL.\nThere is hope that Amazon’s broader sports portfolio will draw greater attention, says Marine, particularly as corporations try to understand where the economy is headed amid threats of new tariffs by the Trump administration. “In times of economic uncertainty, advertisers will move to where they can get the scale they need,” says the executive.","extracted_keywords":["sports","game","year","advertisers","games","ad","media","package","portfolio","day"]}
